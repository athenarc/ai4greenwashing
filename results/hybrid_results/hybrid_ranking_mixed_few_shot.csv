"Shell is on track to meet its climate targets, demonstrating leadership in the energy transition.",greenwashing,RAG,greenwashing,"While Shell reports reductions in emissions and progress towards targets (e.g., 6.3% reduction in net carbon intensity since 2016), the context reveals several issues. Firstly, the reduction in net carbon intensity was ""mainly achieved through...the use of carbon credits,"" which is a controversial practice often criticized as a way to offset emissions without making substantial changes to core business practices. Secondly, despite reductions, Shell's scope 3 emissions (associated with energy products sales) remain very high at 1,147 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent. The claim of ""leadership in the energy transition"" is contradicted by the continued high level of emissions and reliance on offsets, suggesting the claim is misleading given the scale of their overall impact.
