"At Rituals, we are committed that all our packaging will be refillable recyclable, and/or made from recycled materials by 2025. In 2022 alone, our refills saved 802,587 kg in materials, 32,871 GJ-eq in energy, 1,766 tons of CO 2 -eq, and 19.3M litres of water.",not_greenwashing,"The claim states Rituals is committed to having all packaging be refillable, recyclable, or made from recycled materials by 2025. Snippet 2 directly supports this: ""we are committed to designing all our packs to be refillable, recyclable * or made with recycled materials by 2025."" The claim also states savings in 2022 from refills (802,587 kg in materials, etc.). Snippet 4 corroborates this with savings in 2023 (1,033 tons in materials, etc.). The provided context supports the accuracy of the claim.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
"Our founder, Anita Roddick, initiated our first recycling scheme Bring Back Our Bottles in 1993. Then, in 2019, we launched our Return, Recycle, Repeat scheme in five countries. In 2020, we started a refill revolution with refill stations across 500 stores globally. And now, our Return, Recycle, Repeat scheme is back.",not_greenwashing,"The claim details a history of recycling and refill schemes initiated by The Body Shop, starting in 1993 and continuing through 2023. Snippet 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7 all corroborate these initiatives, detailing the ""Bring Back Our Bottles"" scheme (1993), the ""Return, Recycle, Repeat"" scheme (2019, 2022), and the expansion of refill stations (2020, 2022, 2023). The context provides specific data on the amount of plastic prevented from entering waste streams (13.5 tonnes in 2022) and the number of refill stations (793 in 2022, aiming for 850 in 2023). This confirms the accuracy of the claim.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
"Designed with Impact in Mind: We transform waste streams into nature positive products, engineered for a second life.",not_greenwashing,"The claim states Chopvalue ""transforms waste streams into nature positive products, engineered for a second life."" The provided context consistently supports this claim. Snippet 1 states they extract “waste” from streams and keep materials in a “closed loop system.” Snippet 2 highlights their work with brands to accelerate environmental impact. Snippet 6 details how they reutilize waste and educate the community on the circular economy. Snippet 7 explains how they store carbon by preventing chopsticks from ending up in landfills and creating products with multiple life cycles. These excerpts demonstrate a factual basis for the claim, indicating they are indeed transforming waste into products designed for reuse and a positive environmental impact.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
Our circular material is better for you and the planet. Every product made from our engineered performance material means fewer trees cut down for wooden furniture.,not_greenwashing,"The claim states that using Chopvalue material means fewer trees are cut down for wooden furniture. Snippet 1 states the material is a ""climate positive alternative for virgin materials in furniture making,"" and Snippet 2 notes that using Chopvalue material saves CO2 emissions compared to commercial materials. While the claim doesn't explicitly state *how* it's better for the planet, the context supports the idea that it reduces reliance on newly harvested wood, thus reducing deforestation. The claim is therefore factually accurate based on the provided context.",4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.8
The Future of Furniture Is Circular Climate positive wood furniture made locally on a global scale,abstain,"The claim states the furniture is ""climate positive"" and ""circular"" and made ""locally on a global scale."" While the provided context details how Chopvalue material saves CO2 emissions compared to commercial materials (Snippet 2 & 3), and discusses the carbon storage benefits of wood (Snippet 6 & 7), it does not provide enough information to verify if the furniture is definitively ""climate positive"" overall (considering the entire lifecycle and supply chain). The phrase ""locally on a global scale"" is vague and lacks specific details. Therefore, I cannot verify the claim's factual accuracy.",2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0
"Naturepedic’s line of certified organic mattresses are now EWG VERIFIED! As the “First in Category” to receive this distinction, we couldn’t be prouder to lead the industry in setting a new standard for providing safer, healthier sleep for people, the planet, and YOU.",abstain,"The provided context details Naturepedic's various certifications (GOTS, USDA Organic, GOLS, FSC, Greenguard Gold, Vegan Certified, EWG VERIFIED) and sustainability initiatives. However, it does not provide information about the EWG VERIFIED program itself – its standards, verification process, or what ""First in Category"" means.

"Naturepedic's mission includes a strong focus on environmental sustainability. From responsibly sourcing natural and certified organic materials to becoming the first mattress manufacturer ever to earn the EWG VERIFIED® distinction to implementing a packaging system that helps keep 55,000 pounds of single-use plastic out of landfills each year, we are continuously working to improve.",not_greenwashing,"The provided context consistently supports Naturepedic's claims regarding environmental sustainability. Snippet 1 states their focus on ""certified organic and sustainable mattresses, without using toxic or questionable chemicals."" Snippet 2 highlights sustainability as an ""evolving goal"" and their commitment to measuring business and environmental goals. Snippet 3 details efforts to reduce emissions and waste. Snippet 4 mentions membership in organizations promoting sustainable practices and contributions to environmental causes. Snippet 5 emphasizes a ""responsible and sustainable end-of-life approach."" Snippet 7 details specific actions like using renewable energy and energy-efficient lighting. Snippet 8 reiterates their commitment to environmental sustainability and transparency. The claim about keeping 55,000 pounds of plastic out of landfills is also supported by the overall emphasis on sustainable packaging.

That means only the good stuff, and absolutely none of the bad, for hydrated and happy skin.",abstain,"The claim is very broad and relies on subjective terms like ""respect for people and the land,"" ""effective ingredients,"" and ""good stuff."" While the context mentions Burt's Bees' focus on naturally sourced and sustainable products (Snippet 4 & 5), and efforts towards responsible sourcing (Snippet 5), it doesn't provide enough detail to verify whether *all* products are sourced with respect for people and the land, or what constitutes ""effective"" and ""good"" ingredients across the entire product line.

"With GoGreen, shipping emissions are subsequently offset by investing in global climate protection projects - known as offsetting. We automatically apply this process to all letter mail and private customer parcels worldwide - at no extra charge. Business customers can also book the service for their parcels and advertising mail.",not_greenwashing,"Snippet 5 states that offsetting occurs *outside* the value chain of DHL Group and is not recognized by GHG Protocol and SBTi for GHG emission reduction. However, it also states that DHL Group invests in certified climate protection projects (Gold Standard - see Snippet 1) to offset emissions. The claim states that GoGreen offsets emissions by investing in these projects, and the context confirms this practice is in place. While the context clarifies that this offsetting isn't counted towards DHL's own carbon footprint reduction goals, it doesn't mean the offsetting *doesn't happen* as claimed. Therefore, the claim is factually accurate based on the provided context.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

No other logistics company invests as much in e-mobility as we do. We will expand our e-fleet to 38,000 electric delivery vehicles and 14,000 e-trikes by 2025. That means we can also help our public sector customers to meet the requirements of the German Clean Vehicles Procurement Act.",abstain,"While the claim states DHL has the largest fleet of electric commercial vehicles and delivers carbon-free in 50% of districts, the provided context does not definitively confirm or deny these specific percentages. The context details expansion plans and overall electrification efforts (Snippets 1, 2, 5, 7, 8) but lacks the precise data needed to verify the claim's accuracy. It also mentions continued use of gas-powered trucks (Snippet 1), which complicates the ""carbon-free"" assertion without further clarification. Therefore, I must abstain.",4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0
