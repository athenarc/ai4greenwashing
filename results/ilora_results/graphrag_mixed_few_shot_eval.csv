However, the claim is a broad statement about a ""strategic shift"" to ""win in a low-carbon future"" by ""balancing energy demands with decarbonization."" The context does not provide enough information to verify whether this claim represents a genuine, comprehensive shift or is merely aspirational marketing language.

The claim states ""by 2025"", which is a stated goal, but the context does not provide evidence that this goal has been *achieved* globally. While there is evidence of progress (e.g., 19 AWS regions with 100% renewable electricity in 2022), this does not equate to powering *all* global activities with 100% renewable energy.

While the context provides data on various sustainability KPIs, it doesn't directly address the overall carbon footprint change. Therefore, I cannot verify or disprove the claim with the given information. However, the claim itself is a statement of fact (an increase), and simply stating an increase isn't inherently greenwashing.
