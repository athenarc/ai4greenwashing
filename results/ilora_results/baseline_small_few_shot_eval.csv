No other logistics company invests as much in e-mobility as we do. We will expand our e-fleet to 38,000 electric delivery vehicles and 14,000 e-trikes by 2025. That means we can also help our public sector customers to meet the requirements of the German Clean Vehicles Procurement Act.",not_greenwashing,"The claim provides specific numbers regarding the size of the electric vehicle fleet (vans, e-trikes, e-bikes) and the percentage of delivery districts with carbon-free deliveries (50%).

While the claim promotes the company's investment in e-mobility, the provided information appears to be factual and verifiable based on the numbers presented.
