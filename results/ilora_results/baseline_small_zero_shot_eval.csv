These are all verifiable actions that support the claim of a strong focus on environmental sustainability. While the claim uses positive language (""strong focus,"" ""continuously working""), it is backed by concrete examples, and does not appear to be misleading.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
"Today, we make all our products with some of nature’s most effective ingredients, all sourced with respect for people and the land. Each ingredient is chosen for its proven ability to replenish and strengthen a healthy skin barrier. That means only the good stuff, and absolutely none of the bad, for hydrated and happy skin.",abstain,"The claim is very vague and uses subjective language (""good stuff,"" ""bad stuff,"" ""respect""). There is no specific, verifiable information about sourcing practices, ingredient lists, or definitions of ""good"" and ""bad"" ingredients. Without further detail, it's impossible to determine if this is a truthful statement or greenwashing.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
"All our products are over 95% natural origin, without phthalates, parabens, petrolatum, or sodium lauryl sulfate.",abstain,"Without context regarding the specific products or the company making this claim, it is impossible to verify the percentage of natural origin or the absence of listed chemicals. These claims require specific product formulations and testing data to confirm, which is not provided.",1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.2
"With GoGreen, shipping emissions are subsequently offset by investing in global climate protection projects - known as offsetting. We automatically apply this process to all letter mail and private customer parcels worldwide - at no extra charge. Business customers can also book the service for their parcels and advertising mail.",abstain,"The claim states that shipping emissions are offset through investment in climate protection projects. While this describes a carbon offsetting program, without further information about the specific projects, verification standards, or overall effectiveness of the offsetting, it is impossible to determine if the claim is accurate or misleading. It doesn't fall into any greenwashing category based on the information provided, but also cannot be confirmed as ""not greenwashing.""

"With 23,000 electric delivery vans, 13,500 e-trikes and 6,100 e-bikes, ours is the largest fleet of electric commercial vehicles in the world, and our deliveries are carbon-free in about 50% of our delivery districts. No other logistics company invests as much in e-mobility as we do. We will expand our e-fleet to 38,000 electric delivery vehicles and 14,000 e-trikes by 2025. That means we can also help our public sector customers to meet the requirements of the German Clean Vehicles Procurement Act.",abstain,"The claim states facts about the company's electric vehicle fleet size and delivery coverage. While the claim asserts it is the ""largest"" and ""no other logistics company invests as much,"" verifying these statements requires external data comparing this company to all other logistics companies globally, which is not provided in the context. The claim about helping public sector customers meet the German Clean Vehicles Procurement Act is also unverifiable without knowing the specifics of that Act and the company's assistance. Therefore, I cannot verify the factual accuracy of the claim.",2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.8
