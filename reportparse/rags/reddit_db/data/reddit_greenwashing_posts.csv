It’s whitewashing, but with a green brush.A classic example is an energy company that runs an advertising campaign touting a “green” technology they’re working on — but that “green” technology represents only a sliver of the company’s otherwise not-so-green business, or may be marketed on the heels of an oil spill or plant explosion.ABOUT GREENWASHING WHAT IS GREENWASHING? IT’S WHITEWASHING, BUT WITH A GREEN BRUSH. Everyone’s heard the expression “whitewashing” — it’s defined as “a coordinated attempt to hide unpleasant facts, especially in a political context.” “Greenwashing” is the same premise, but in an environmental context. It’s greenwashing when a company or organization spends more time and money claiming to be “green” through advertising and marketing than actually implementing business practices that minimize environmental impact. It’s whitewashing, but with a green brush. A classic example is an energy company that runs an advertising campaign touting a “green” technology they’re working on — but that “green” technology represents only a sliver of the company’s otherwise not-so-green business, or may be marketed on the heels of an oil spill or plant explosion."
2,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Foods#Products,1glqou,Dean Foods - Wikipedia,"Dean Foods was an American food and beverage company and the largest dairy company in the United States.[3] The company's products included milk, ice cream, dairy products, cheese, juice, and teas.[4][5] It processed milk in the United States under a number of regional and national brands.[6] Founded in 1925, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2019, and its assets were acquired by several buyers in 2020.Headquartered in Dallas, Texas, Dean Foods maintained plants and distributors across the United States.[1] The company had 66 manufacturing facilities in 32 U.S. states and distributed its products across all 50 states.[6][7] Through acquisition and licensing, Dean produced dairy products under many well-known national and regional brand names such as: DairyPure, TruMoo, Friendly's, Mayfield, Dean's, Meadow Gold, Purity, Tuscan, T.G.Lee and Alta Dena.[6]Dean Foods was founded by Samuel E. Dean Sr., who owned an evaporated milk processing facility in Franklin Park, Illinois, in the 1920s.[8] After purchasing other Illinois dairy plants Dean developed the enterprise ""from a small regional dairy into a diversified food company"".[9][10]In December 2001, the legacy brand of Dean Foods was acquired by the Dallas-based Suiza Foods Corporation, who later adopted the Dean Foods name.[11] As part of the merger, 11 plants were divested under the name National Dairy to a group led by Dairy Farmers of America.[12] In the first quarter of 2010 the company moved to the Cityplace district of Dallas, Texas.[13][14]In November 2019, Southern Foods Group, LLC d/b/a Dean Foods, and forty-two affiliated companies filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas on November 12, 2019. The company cited the decline in consumption of cow's milk products;[15][16][17][18] rendering them unable to meet their debt and pension obligations. The company stated that they were working with potential buyers for the company's assets.[19][20][21][22] The cooperative Dairy Farmers of America was specifically named as a potential buyer.[15] In 2020, all of Dean's assets were acquired by several companies. The largest share of assets was purchased by Dairy Farmers of America for $425 million.[23][24][when?]In May 2015 Dean Foods announced that they would introduce a national milk brand, DairyPure, which would appear alongside regional brands, in an attempt to boost sales.[28]In October 2010, Dean Foods announced it was retiring the Schepps brand for dairy products in the Dallas, Texas area in favor of their Oak Farms brand. The Schepps brand had been in the Dallas market since 1942.[14][31]In 2005, Dean Specialty Foods was spun off from Dean Foods as Bay Valley Foods, LLC, a division of TreeHouse Foods, Inc.[32] In June 2005, TreeHouse Foods started trading on the New York Stock Exchange with a ticker of THS.[32]In August 2006, Dean Foods acquired Jilbert's Dairy, a 70-year-old family business near Marquette, Michigan.[33]Dean Food's TofuTown brand was acquired by the Hain Celestial Group in June 2007.In December, Dean Foods bought the Wells Dairy milk plant in Le Mars, Iowa. The plant manufactured Blue Bunny ice cream. [34]Dean Foods purchased Alpro in 2009 for an estimated US$455 million, making it a ""global leader in soy beverages"".[35] At that time, the company was restructured and a number of subsidiaries were sold, including Rachel's Organic.[36]Dean Foods spun off WhiteWave Foods, the maker of Horizon Organic and Silk Soymilk, as a standalone company in May 2013.[37]In March 2005, the Cornucopia Institute filed a complaint with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) alleging that their Horizon Organic subsidiary was violating ""organic livestock management"" standards.[38][39]On May 12, 2008, the Cornucopia Institute filed a second complaint with the USDA again alleging that Deans Foods had violated federal organic regulations requiring access to pasture and fresh grass for their dairy cows.[40]Silk brand soy milk was made using organic soybeans until early 2009, when Dean Foods switched to conventional soybeans while maintaining the same UPC barcodes and prices on the Silk products and replacing the word “organic” with “natural” on the product's packaging,[41] prompting the Cornucopia Institute to file complaints that the company had not properly notified retailers or consumers.[42][43]Foremost Farms USA, a cooperative of over 2,000 dairy farmers in several mid-western states, sold its Wisconsin milk processing plants to Dean Foods in 2009.[44] In January 2010, the US Department of Justice and the state attorneys general's office of Wisconsin and Michigan, filed a lawsuit objecting to the purchase and alleged that it created a monopolizing provider.[45] Dean Foods announced it was contesting the complaint.[46]In 2011, a class action suit was brought against Dean Foods over health claims made on the packaging of Horizon Organic Milk.[47] In 2012, Dean Foods contributed $253,950 to fund opposition to California's ballot Proposition 37 which would require mandatory labeling of foods containing genetically modified ingredients.[48][49]In 2017, bettor and stock trader Billy Walters was convicted of insider trading in Dean shares in Federal court. Walters' source of non-public information was company director Thomas C. Davis employing a prepaid cell phone nicknamed ""the Batphone"" and, sometimes, the code words ""Dallas Cowboys"" for the company name. The case involved profits or avoided losses of $40 million from 2008 to 2014. The verdict was to be appealed according to Walters' lawyer.[50]Country Fresh, Michigan and WisconsinCreamland, New MexicoDean's, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and PennsylvaniaLehigh Valley, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey and PennsylvaniaMayfield Dairy, Virginia, Georgia, and TennesseeOak Farms Dairy, Texas, Louisiana and OklahomaBerkeley Farms, Northern California and Northern Nevada: 1910–2020Liberty Dairy, Grand Rapids, MichiganMeadow Gold Dairy, Hawaii and NebraskaH.

6,https://inthesetimes.com/article/21995/6-corporate-climate-schemes-bp-cargill-fedex-virgin-adm-bunge-fiji,d51dte,6 Greenwashing Schemes That Show Corporations Will Never Lead on Climate - In These Times,"This article is part of Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of more than 250 news outlets to strengthen coverage of the climate story.Forget the youth activists capturing the country’s imagination with calls for a Green New Deal and the progressive politicians pushing for it: The clearest signal that climate change demands action comes from the planet’s corporations.Corporations worldwide are announcing new plans to eliminate climate impact from their operations, and would have you believe they are well on their way to building the green economy voluntarily, no need for major economic reform. It would seem the dirtier the industry, the bigger the ambition. HeidelbergCement, for example, the world’s second-largest cement producer, pledged to produce carbon-neutral concrete by 2050, a goal in line with the Paris Agreement. It was a first for an industry that is the world’s third-largest industrial energy consumer, according to the International Energy Agency. Xcel Energy, meanwhile, one of the biggest utilities in the United States, is closing coal-fired power plants and moving aggressively into wind and solar renewables, claiming it will be “carbon-free” by 2050.Corporate sustainability programs today extend to suppliers and subcontractors, as well, and some big banks are beginning to factor climate change risk assessments into their lending decisions. Even ExxonMobil, arguably the most environmentally unfriendly corporation of all time, claims, “We believe that climate change risks warrant action and it’s going to take all of us — business, governments and consumers — to make meaningful progress.”It’s little wonder that executives are worried: A 2019 survey of 215 large companies from the nonprofit CDP found they expect to lose as much as $1 trillion from climate impacts in years to come. Clean energy would save money in the long run while winning reputational currency with consumers. Yet few of these corporations have put their heft behind robust government climate policies. In fact, polluting corporations have poured millions of dollars into lobbying efforts against new environmental regulations, suggesting they only want climate action if they set the terms.But could voluntary corporate environmental cleanups and self-policing solve the problem? To answer, In These Times looked back at some of the most ambitious corporate environmental promises of recent decades. It’s not very encouraging.The transportation sector is the biggest pollutor in the U.S., accounting for 29% of total emissions in 2017, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Medium-duty and heavy-duty trucks (for cargo, firefighting and other services) contribute 23% of transportation emissions; these emissions increased by 90% between 1990 and 2017. Commercial ground shipping is poised to remain a major polluter for the foreseeable future.The picture once seemed rosier. In 2000, FedEx teamed with the Environmental Defense Fund to develop a “revolutionary” hybrid truck design to bring down greenhouse gas emissions by 30% while reducing air pollution. FedEx planned to start replacing its dirtier-burning diesel trucks in 2003 with the potential of rolling out 30,000 new vehicles in a decade. “I can’t envision any reason why we wouldn’t roll this out over the whole fleet,” one executive said.“By making this commitment, they are taking a giant step forward for the environment in the United States,” Geroge W. Bush’s EPA administrator, Christine Todd Whitman, told the New York Times.The revolution never took hold. By 2010, FedEx had added only a few hundred electric and hybrid vehicles, citing the “daunting” costs of purchasing or converting vehicles.Today, the company has fewer than 4,000 “alternative energy vehicles” on the road — about 2% of its ground fleet of 180,000+ vehicles worldwide, lagging behind UPS (with more than 10,000 alternative fuel vehicles in its total fleet of 123,000).After balking at the cost of a new green fleet, FedEx (like much of the ground shipping industry) has refocused its “sustainability” work on relatively low-hanging fruit such as making improvements to its existing fleet’s fuel efficiency (which can save money without major new investments). FedEx has made strides, improving fuel efficiency 39.6% from a 2005 baseline, and claims to still be “revolutioniz[ing]” the industry. But none of this moves to transition corporate ground fleets to renewable fuel.Maritime shipping, one of the more difficult sectors to decarbonize due to the lack of viable alternative fuels at the ready, accounts for 2.2% of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions, according to the United Nations International Maritime Organization.In 2011, the international commodities trader Cargill captured imaginations by installing a giant kite on the dry bulk cargo ship Aghia Marina, making it the world’s largest kiteassisted cargo ship. The system works by harnessing powerful high-altitude winds to propel cargo ships, reducing fuel consumption by up to 35% (depending on weather conditions) according to SkySails, the German engineering company that pioneered the concept.Fuel is one of this industry’s biggest costs, so adding sail technology seemed like a win-win. The pilot ship grabbed international headlines and appeared poised to scale up to become a new industry standard.Even the online environmental site TreeHugger praised Cargill, saying, in 2011, that the project was “worth recognizing” (even as they remained critical of some of Cargill’s other practices).But by 2015, Cargill was saying that it had “encountered obstacles that demonstrate the challenge of making windpowered vessels a reality,” and the project was ended. The Aghia Marina was sold in 2017, around which time the SkySails system was removed, according to SkySails founder Stephan Wrage.“I think [the sail system] should have been installed on a new vessel,” Wrage says. But that never happened. Cargo ship owners, Wrage says, have generally resisted adopting new technology such as kite sails, despite the proven cost savings. The reason is that cargo ship owners aren’t the ones paying for fuel. Fuel costs are passed onto charter customers (like Cargill), so the ship owners generally don’t make expensive energy efficiency upgrades, no matter the climate-saving potential.Cargill, apparently, was unwilling or unable to leverage its international stature and business scale to push for a sea change in the shipping industry. Nevertheless, today it still wants full credit for its short-lived sail experiment, insisting that its aborted pilot project “does underscore Cargill’s commitment to investing in innovative shipping solutions that aim to transform the industry.”Aviation makes up roughly 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, one of the fastest-growing sources. Since the mid-2000s, some airlines have offered passengers a chance to assuage their own carbon guilt by purchasing carbon offsets: For an extra fee, flyers buy into forest management and other environmentally friendly projects to balance out the carbon they’re using. Virgin Atlantic Airways helped lead the charge — on the public relations front, at least.Promising its carbon offsets are tested against “strict criteria about what counts as a carbon reduction,” Virgin assures customers that carbon credits support environmental conservation and improve “people’s lives by delivering household savings, health benefits and improving water resources.”But at least one offset project advertised by Virgin has proved to be a sham. The environmental and social justice organization Fern issued a failing grade, in 2017, to Virgin’s offset credits for forest conservation in Oddar Meanchey, Cambodia. An investigation found that nearly half of the forest that was supposed to be protected had been clear-cut. Fern’s Julia Christian told the Phnom Penh Post those carbon credits “are bogus — they are based on emissions savings that never happened, because the forest was destroyed, not protected.”A few months after Fern’s report made international headlines, Virgin stopped selling the Oddar Meanchey offsets.A Virgin spokesperson said the company had acted “in good faith” when selecting the project, though critics had publicly raised concerns years prior.It’s not that preserving forests isn’t an effective decarbonization method, but that forest offset programs too often fail to prevent deforestation. In May 2019, ProPublica issued an investigative report that examined two decades of offsets and concluded that forest carbon credits “may be worse than nothing,” giving “polluters a guilt-free pass to keep emitting CO2” with little to no climate benefit. The programs are also controversial with social justice and indigenous rights groups who see local communities losing their age-old ways of life after conservationists cut off their access to hunting, fishing and foraging.Despite these problems, the International Civil Aviation Organization’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) is still relying on offsets for its industry-wide goal of carbon-neutral growth by 2020.Thomas Mooney, senior vice president for sustainable growth at Fiji Water, claimed in a 2008 press release, “Consumers who choose Fiji Water will actually be helping the environment by taking carbon out of the atmosphere with every purchase.” Labels reading “every drop is green” appeared on Fiji bottles in supermarkets and hotel rooms, along with a “carbon neutral” claim. But very few things in life are truly carbon-free.Producing plastic bottles and shipping water from Fiji to the rest of the world comes with a heavy environmental cost, and Fiji’s promise to neutralize “120%” of its carbon emissions was based on so-called forward crediting, a scheme that allowed the company to tout its carbon-negative status in 2008 even though its emissions wouldn’t (theoretically) achieve that status until 2037, according to calculations by the international nature group, Conservation International (CI), that partnered with Fiji on the project. The idea was to rely on conservation projects in Fiji — which, we know, is no guarantee of forest preservation. Billionaire Stewart Resnick, who co-owns Fiji Water, happened to be a longtime CI board member, and CI worked for Fiji Water in exchange for conservation funding. (Full disclosure: This author briefly worked for Conservation International in 2006, which led to her whistleblowing book, Green, Inc.: An Environmental Insider Reveals How a Good Cause Has Gone Bad.)In 2011, a California woman launched a class-action lawsuit arguing Fiji was “claim[ing] credit for carbon removal that may or may not take place — up to several decades in the future.” The case was dismissed, but the company has stopped using the carbon-neutral label.Remember “Beyond Petroleum”? In 2001, the oil company BP (formerly known as British Petroleum) rebranded as an environmental champion, adopting its “Beyond” slogan.Its solar subsidiary, BP Solar, was a big part of the Beyond Petroleum efforts. In its mid-2000s heyday, solar panel manufacturer BP Solar enjoyed a brief era of profitability. In 2004, the company reported, “The solar business grew sales by 38% and delivered a full-year operating profit for the first time.”Shortly after that record year, however, Chinese solar panel manufacturers introduced cheap new products to the market. By 2008, Chinese solar panels were selling for 80% less than others in the industry, driving out competition and allowing China to seize a leadership position in solar that it still maintains.By 2010, BP’s solar subsidiary was already feeling the heat of Chinese competition when the Deepwater Horizon oil spill left 11 workers dead and allowed 4 million barrels of oil to flow into the Gulf of Mexico, a serious crack in the company’s green image. BP Solar closed in 2011, succumbing to Chinese competition, and the Beyond Petroleum slogan soon faded away.BP did not buy its way back into solar until December 2017, with a $200 million investment in Europe’s largest solar developer, Lightsource. But the company has never been close to going beyond petroleum — then or now.Even in 2004, 96% of BP’s net profits came from dirty old fossil fuels, with just 4% coming from solar and other renewables. In 2018, meanwhile, the company reported $12.7 billion in underlying replacement cost profit (effectively net income), which highlights the tiny nature of its $200 million Lightsource solar investment. As Valentina Kretzschmar, the director of research at oil analysis firm Wood Mackenzie, put it in 2018, “the amount of money spent is still peanuts compared to their core business.”U.S.-headquartered commodities traders Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), Bunge and Cargill, which supply world markets with a vast array of raw materials, have long stood accused of encouraging farmers to cut deeper into the Amazon and other forests, bulldozing biodiverse ecosystems to make way for fields of soybeans, African palm and other cash crops.Various corporate sustainability programs have committed to stop purchasing commodity crops grown on recently deforested land and all three of the aforementioned big traders have turned to “traceability” systems to account for every grain, seed and fruit in a supply chain and link them back to where they grew. Bunge says it has achieved more than 90% traceability for farms it sources from directly in “high-priority areas” around the world and is monitoring more than 6,700 farms and 200 independent grain elevators. Cargill has pledged “to transform our agricultural supply chains to be deforestation-free.”However, “The Ultimate Mystery Meat,” a 2017 investigation by the activist organization Mighty Earth, charged Bunge and Cargill with driving deforestation in Brazil and Bolivia.“Bunge has adopted a strong policy on paper to prohibit deforestation in its supply chain, but hasn’t widely communicated the policy to its suppliers,” the report reads. And “Cargill has given itself until 2030 to eliminate deforestation from its supply chains, giving soy growers and others almost 15 years to race to clear as much forest as possible.”The problem is industrywide. Geospatial analyst Philip Curtis, a researcher with the Sustainability Consortium, found that forest clearing for commodities crops remained steady between 2001 and 2015, with an area the size of Costa Rica lost every year to industrial agriculture. “The scale of the loss was staggering,” he told Science.Corporations clearly have robust information about climate impacts, and the significant resources needed to address the problem. And despite rampant greenwashing (revealing a commitment to public relations rather than real sustainability), corporate leaders have undeniably elevated the public conversation about climate change while politicians have too often remained silent. Arguably, however, they do so only as far (and as often) as public opinion requires.As we’ve seen from FedEx, Cargill and others, some of today’s most successful and ruthlessly competitive corporations — despite claiming to be transforming an industry — have exhibited a surprising lack of grit, quietly folding at the first obstacle to their boldest green ambitions.This apparent inconsistency often seems deliberate, with companies demanding climate action while supporting trade associations and politicians who deny that climate change is even happening. Many continue protecting old business models, while hedging their bets with new clean tech products and services. Some of today’s biggest polluters — oil and gas companies and big utilities — are planning for big profits from the renewable energy transition, even while continuing business as usual for as long as possible.History shows that individual corporations have failed to follow through on promised change without government regulatory action. “I don’t think [the transportation] industry would [decarbonize] if they are not highly incentivized to do it, or required in some aspects,” says Lewis Fulton, director of the Sustainable Transportation Energy Pathways program at the University of California, Davis.The failure of corporate sustainability efforts also bodes poorly for the kind of laissez-faire policies that corporations hold up as the answer to climate change. These include market-based pricing mechanisms, such as cap and trade, which not only rely heavily on offsets but implicitly trust corporations to set their own path toward sustainability with limited state intervention. “Making tweaks to a market mechanism and hoping that industry will respond correctly” will likely be insufficient, says Brian Nowicki at the Center for Biological Diversity. What’s needed are “bold actions where we actually redirect where our resources are and what we are investing in as a state and as a country.”The renowned late environmentalist David Brower is credited with saying that all environmental victories are temporary, while each defeat is a permanent loss. The opposite could be said of corporate sustainability claims: Corporations want everlasting credit for their investments in nature, but for their failures to be instantly forgotten.CHRISTINE MACDONALD is an investigative reporter and author, whose work focuses climate change, environmental sustainability and greenwashing. She was a 2019-2020 fellow with the Leonard C. Goodman Institute for Investigative Reporting.SEPTEMBER 16, 2019FEATUREFEATURE 6 Greenwashing Schemes That Show Corporations Will Never Lead on Climate More and more companies are setting public goals for reducing their greenhouse gas emissions. History shows they can’t be trusted. CHRISTINE MACDONALD SEPTEMBER 16, 2019 Illustrations by Erin McCluskeyPUBLISHED IN SEPTEMBER 2019 This article is part of Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of more than 250 news outlets to strengthen coverage of the climate story. The failure of corporate sustainability efforts also bodes poorly for the kind of laissez-faire policies that corporations hold up as the answer to climate change. Forget the youth activists capturing the country’s imagination with calls for a Green New Deal and the progressive politicians pushing for it: The clearest signal that climate change demands action comes from the planet’s corporations. Corporations worldwide are announcing new plans to eliminate climate impact from their operations, and would have you believe they are well on their way to building the green economy voluntarily, no need for major economic reform. It would seem the dirtier the industry, the bigger the ambition. HeidelbergCement, for example, the world’s second-largest cement producer, pledged to produce carbon-neutral concrete by 2050, a goal in line with the Paris Agreement. It was a first for an industry that is the world’s third-largest industrial energy consumer, according to the International Energy Agency. Xcel Energy, meanwhile, one of the biggest utilities in the United States, is closing coal-fired power plants and moving aggressively into wind and solar renewables, claiming it will be “carbon-free” by 2050. Corporate sustainability programs today extend to suppliers and subcontractors, as well, and some big banks are beginning to factor climate change risk assessments into their lending decisions. Even ExxonMobil, arguably the most environmentally unfriendly corporation of all time, claims, “We believe that climate change risks warrant action and it’s going to take all of us — business, governments and consumers — to make meaningful progress.” It’s little wonder that executives are worried: A 2019 survey of 215 large companies from the nonprofit CDP found they expect to lose as much as $1 trillion from climate impacts in years to come. Clean energy would save money in the long run while winning reputational currency with consumers. Yet few of these corporations have put their heft behind robust government climate policies. In fact, polluting corporations have poured millions of dollars into lobbying efforts against new environmental regulations, suggesting they only want climate action if they set the terms. But could voluntary corporate environmental cleanups and self-policing solve the problem? To answer, In These Times looked back at some of the most ambitious corporate environmental promises of recent decades. It’s not very encouraging. 1 The transportation sector is the biggest pollutor in the U.S., accounting for 29% of total emissions in 2017, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Medium-duty and heavy-duty trucks (for cargo, firefighting and other services) contribute 23% of transportation emissions; these emissions increased by 90% between 1990 and 2017. Commercial ground shipping is poised to remain a major polluter for the foreseeable future. The picture once seemed rosier. In 2000, FedEx teamed with the Environmental Defense Fund to develop a “revolutionary” hybrid truck design to bring down greenhouse gas emissions by 30% while reducing air pollution. FedEx planned to start replacing its dirtier-burning diesel trucks in 2003 with the potential of rolling out 30,000 new vehicles in a decade. “I can’t envision any reason why we wouldn’t roll this out over the whole fleet,” one executive said. “By making this commitment, they are taking a giant step forward for the environment in the United States,” Geroge W. Bush’s EPA administrator, Christine Todd Whitman, told the New York Times. The revolution never took hold. By 2010, FedEx had added only a few hundred electric and hybrid vehicles, citing the “daunting” costs of purchasing or converting vehicles. Today, the company has fewer than 4,000 “alternative energy vehicles” on the road — about 2% of its ground fleet of 180,000+ vehicles worldwide, lagging behind UPS (with more than 10,000 alternative fuel vehicles in its total fleet of 123,000). After balking at the cost of a new green fleet, FedEx (like much of the ground shipping industry) has refocused its “sustainability” work on relatively low-hanging fruit such as making improvements to its existing fleet’s fuel efficiency (which can save money without major new investments). FedEx has made strides, improving fuel efficiency 39.6% from a 2005 baseline, and claims to still be “revolutioniz[ing]” the industry. But none of this moves to transition corporate ground fleets to renewable fuel. 2 Maritime shipping, one of the more difficult sectors to decarbonize due to the lack of viable alternative fuels at the ready, accounts for 2.2% of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions, according to the United Nations International Maritime Organization.

Findings just released by the Guardian show that big-money managers such as BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street “used their votes to frequently oppose efforts to improve climate-related financial disclosures.”Shareholder resolutions aren’t legally binding, of course, but the idea that “shareholder governance” — particularly through the leadership of large fund managers — can pressure companies to adopt sustainable practices has seen renewed excitement.Increasingly, big investors and fund managers are positioning themselves as ethical intermediaries at the center of a new movement for “impact investing” — investments that claim to prioritize environmental, social, and governance concerns. BlackRock, Invesco, Aberdeen, and Vanguard — all of whom who have signed on to the UN-supported Principles for Responsible Investment — promise that they can help align people’s money with their values.“Socially responsible investing” has been around for decades, but it’s taken off recently. Sustainable assets under management are now estimated to be around $30 trillion. So-called green bonds — fixed income instruments used to fund green projects such as wind farms or low-impact housing — have proliferated. Even entire countries — Belgium, France, Poland, Indonesia — are issuing them.Meanwhile, companies like Vanguard have set up new “green” exchange-traded funds that exclude oil and gas companies and nuclear power.

Back in the ’90s, the small number of investors interested in “corporate social responsibility” used metrics provided by the Global Reporting Initiative. These days CSR (corporate social responsibility) has been replaced with ESG (environmental, social, and governance) numbers that include data on emissions, labor practices, diversity, board independence, and supply chain information — the vast majority of which is self-reported by companies.There are more than 150 ESG ratings systems used by companies worldwide that include thousands of bespoke, non-comparable performance metrics. As investors and fund managers have become more interested in ESG metrics, and governments and regulatory agencies consider the possibility of mandating that companies produce and disclose ESG data, a cottage industry of ESG metric providers has popped up. The emerging sector is worth an estimated $200 million and set to grow to $500 million in the next five years.With little government oversight and a lot of money on the table, the scramble to supply the chosen ESG yardstick is getting fierce. On top of widely recognized metrics offered by the Global Reporting Initiative, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, other big players are getting into the game. Moody’s bought Vigeo Eiris and Four Twenty Seven, two ESG ratings and research firms, while the S&P is putting together its own ESG ratings business. Not to be left out, Harvard Business School and a European venture capital firm are developing the “Impact-Weighted Accounts Initiative” to generate a unified system of measures that all companies can use.The possibility of more widely available “green” assets graded according to standardized global metrics has investors and money managers seeing dollar signs. Not only are these assets extremely popular, but a green label could potentially qualify them for special treatment from regulators. The European Commission, for example, has suggested that in the future, certified green investments could be subject to lower capital requirements, making it cheaper for banks and investors to fund these types of assets.So is tackling climate change simply about getting the incentives right? Is a more robust, standardized market in ESG metrics the key to reaching global emissions targets? Unfortunately not, for at least two reasons.The first reason is that, just as companies are not compelled to honor shareholder resolutions, large investors and fund managers are not our allies. According to FundVotes, a project that tracks proxy voting, BlackRock, Invesco, BNY Mellon, and Vanguard have all voted against shareholder resolutions raised at ExxonMobil’s and Chevron’s annual meetings aimed at increasing corporate disclosures on climate change. The Guardian’s recent investigation confirms this finding: “BlackRock and Vanguard opposed or abstained on more than 80 percent of climate-related motions at FTSE 100 and S&P 500 fossil fuel companies between 2015 and 2019.”The explanation for money managers’ unwillingness to use their clout to spur the transition from fossil fuels is simple: they have huge investments in dirty energy companies. BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street, the three biggest fund managers, boast “a combined $300 billion fossil fuel investment portfolio” — a portfolio that has grown nearly 35 percent since 2016.A second reason why we can’t rely on market mechanisms to solve climate change is that, right now, a “green” label on funds and bonds has no legal basis — and companies and their political allies are working hard to keep it that way. If green funds and bonds invest in companies and projects that are not actually green, there are no legal repercussions, only reputational repercussions. In just one example of how investors are routinely misled, a $500 million Vanguard exchange-traded green fund was recently found to have investments in oil and gas companies despite promises to the contrary. And, because there are so many ESG metrics, just about any company can market itself as green — hence “green” fracking companies.Even insiders recognize the limits of green capitalism. As Hans Hoogervorst, the chairman of the International Accounting Standards Board, put it recently: “We should not expect sustainability reporting to be very effective in inducing companies to prioritize planet over profit . . . Greenwashing is rampant.”Self-reports, ratings systems, and the supposed green intentions of the world’s largest money managers won’t curb the voracious appetites of the world’s biggest corporations. ESG metrics and impact investing are mostly hype — an opportunity for “woke” capitalists to cash in on our desire to preserve the planet for future generations.

But this is the first project to be announced that specifically aims to power electrolysers using only excess renewable power. Other green H2 projects announced to date are seeking to receive their power from dedicated renewables projects, as green hydrogen becomes cheaper to produce the more hours per day the electrolysers are operating. The three companies point out that Belgium will have 2.26GW of offshore wind installed by the end of this year, with a further 1.75GW to be developed.

About 69 million tonnes of hydrogen are produced every year, largely for use in oil refining, fertiliser production and a host of other sectors where H2 is a core part of a product’s DNA. About 99% of this hydrogen is derived from fossil fuels, releasing 830 million tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere every year, according to the International Energy Agency — more than the UK, France and Belgium combined. The main hydrogen-producing process, steam methane reforming, releases nine to 12 tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere for every tonne of H2. This “grey hydrogen” is far cheaper to produce than green hydrogen, costing an average of about $1.50 per kilogram, with the renewable H2 said to be five to 10 times more expensive. However, a Canadian company recently put its green hydrogen on sale for only C$3.50 ($2.67) per kg, while several studies have suggested that green H2 could become cost-competitive with grey by 2030 through economies of scale.

11,https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/natural-gas-bridge-nearing-end,euxqlw,Where Does the Natural Gas 'Bridge' End? | Greentech Media,"ABU DHABI — The role of natural gas is one of the stickier points of debate related to the global energy transition, and that debate was on full display here this month.Meg Gentle, president and CEO of Houston-based gas company Tellurian, argued that natural gas is a key driver of the energy transition and is already lowering emissions by replacing dirtier fuels like coal and oil.“I view natural gas and LNG as already part of the solution,” she said at the Atlantic Council's Global Energy Forum. “We’ll have some emissions throughout our value chain, but the benefit that we will have [for] overall CO2 emissions is actually 10 times the emissions that we will contribute.”The advent of the fracking boom caused natural-gas prices to plummet, which has helped to rapidly shift coal out of the U.S. power system. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports from the U.S. and Australia are now surging and making their way to several of the world’s top coal consuming countries.But while a transition to natural gas is already underway, it’s unclear what the future of that fossil fuel will look like as policies shift and other, cleaner resources become more competitive.Adnan Amin, former director-general of International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and current senior fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center, argued that the role of natural gas is being overstated in most forecasts.“We have been talking about, for the last few years, gas as the bridge,” Amin said during Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week. “There is an inevitability about bridges, which is that sooner or later you get to the end of the bridge.""The combination of artificial intelligence, smart grid technologies and energy storage is undermining the argument that gas is needed to manage the intermittency of renewable energy resources, Amin noted. The geopolitics of natural gas and rising global emissions are also challenging previously held assumptions around what the optimal energy mix should be.A recent study published in the scientific journal Environmental Research Letters found that natural-gas use has grown so quickly that emissions from gas over the past six years have surpassed the decline in emissions resulting from a reduced use of coal. The study found that fossil fuel emissions grew at a slower rate in 2019 than in previous years but did not account for methane emissions from fossil fuel production and shipping.Economic and environmental factors are now prompting a number of U.S. cities and utilities to impose bans on new natural-gas infrastructure. Last week, the California Public Utilities Commission launched a new regulatory proceeding “to manage the state’s transition away from natural-gas-fueled technologies to meet California’s decarbonization goals.""The cost of wind and solar have decreased dramatically over the past decade, to the point where renewables are now cheaper than new-build natural-gas plants in many parts of the world. According to Wood Mackenzie, solar may be able to out-compete new gas-fired plants virtually everywhere on a levelized cost basis by the year 2023.Within the next decade, renewables are expected to be cheaper than even existing gas plants, prompting the question of stranded assets.And it's not just happening in high-income parts of the world. Renewables are already cheaper to build and use than existing natural-gas plants in several of the markets where Enel operates, Enel Green Power CEO Antonio Cammisecra said in a phone interview.“In many countries, we observe that it is more convenient to build new wind or solar than operate existing thermal assets,” Cammisecra said. “This is really just the start of a big, big phenomenon that is happening in major economies but also in emerging countries where we invest.”Yet despite the growing scrutiny being directed at natural-gas investments, Marco Alverà, CEO of Italian gas company Snam S.p.A., doesn’t see global gas demand plummeting anytime soon and pushed back on Amin’s assertion that the natural gas “bridge” is nearing its end.Alverà noted on stage in Abu Dhabi that IRENA’s own reports put renewable energy penetration at just over 50 percent in 2050 under the most ambitious deployment scenario. That means roughly half of the global energy mix will still come from hydrocarbons, according to the renewable energy agency’s research.“That bridge to 2050 is not a short bridge,” said Alverà. “And it’s not a complete bridge.”“There’s no model out there that assumes a minimal role for gas, even in 2050, [despite what] some people in the audience have vouched for or expect,” he added.Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, said at another conference that the IEA sees an enormous increase in natural-gas use in future, fueled by an abundance of supply and high demand from China and India.Also, while investors are shifting their focus to cleaner energy resources, few have been willing to fully abandon natural gas. Despite committing to shift BlackRock’s capital allocation to more climate-friendly solutions earlier this month, CEO Larry Fink expressed reservations about ditching hydrocarbons entirely.Musabbeh Al Kaabi, CEO of petroleum and petrochemicals for Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund Mubadala, touted the firm's investments in more than 4 gigawatts of renewable energy power generation. But he said at the Atlantic Council Forum that while ""renewable energy is at the core of our view of the future...natural gas...is very important in achieving the energy transition going forward.""A big challenge for natural-gas interests going forward will be to make the case that their resource continues to be an environmentally friendly option once even dirtier resources are pushed out of the mix.Meg Gentle of Tellurian acknowledged that the industry needs to do more to reduce emissions over the lifecycle of the product, from the wellhead to the ship. Potential solutions include blocking methane leaks, investing in carbon capture and sequestration, and purchasing carbon offsets, she said.But even these steps still may not be enough.European Commissioner for Energy Kadri Simson said at another event that the EU’s Green Deal was crafted not only as an environmental policy but also to address the bloc’s energy security issues related to natural gas.Simson noted that the EU currently relies heavily on Russia for its gas supply “but [is] moving toward a bigger share of renewables...[so we will not be] so dependent anymore.” Going forward, the European bloc will be investing more into the electricity grid and strengthening links between member states to accommodate a bigger share of renewable energy.The EU has also expanded its LNG terminals to accept more U.S. gas, and Simson acknowledged that gas “will have a role during our transition period.” But investments in gas must be “future-proof,” she said.To that end, she said decarbonizing gas with hydrogen is one of the EU’s top priorities. The EU ultimately plans to push out gas completely.“We don’t need any stranded assets,” said Simson.ABU DHABI — The role of natural gas is one of the stickier points of debate related to the global energy transition, and that debate was on full display here this month. Meg Gentle, president and CEO of Houston-based gas company Tellurian, argued that natural gas is a key driver of the energy transition and is already lowering emissions by replacing dirtier fuels like coal and oil.

12,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-51229604,evkiu8,Climate change: UK has 'one shot' at success at Glasgow COP26,"If the Glasgow climate conference fails to deliver, it could mark the end of the global approach to tackling the problem.COP26 in November will see around 200 world leaders meet to agree a new, long term deal on rising temperatures.But according to Claire O'Neill, the president of COP26, the UK has ""one shot"" at making it a success.She told a BBC documentary that if Glasgow fails, people will question the whole UN approach.COP26 marks a critical moment for the UN in the long running effort to find a global solution to climate change.As part of the Paris climate deal, agreed in 2015, countries are meant to update their carbon cutting plans by the end of this year.So far, 114 say they have done this, or are in the process of doing so this year.Another 120 countries have now told the UN that they have either agreed on plans to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 or are working towards that goal.While this represents some progress, a key part of the Glasgow meeting will be trying to push countries to go even further.In December, there was widespread dismay after countries failed to agree on more ambitious steps at the Madrid conference of the parties known as COP25.The messy compromise in the Spanish capital has also left a raft of complex issues unresolved, including the use of carbon markets, plus the question of compensation for loss and damage suffered by poorer nations from storms and rising sea levels.Underpinning the lack of progress in Madrid was the huge gap between big emitters such as Brazil, Australia, India, China and US and an alliance of countries wanting to go much faster including the European Union, small island states and vulnerable nations.Former UK minister Claire O'Neill has been tasked with presiding over COP26 and delivering an agreement acceptable to all.Widely seen as knowledgeable and authoritative, Ms O'Neill says that Glasgow is the best, and perhaps last chance to make progress under the long drawn out UN process.""I think we have one shot,"" she said, speaking to the BBC at the end of the Madrid conference in December.""I think if we don't have a successful outcome next year people will legitimately look at us and say 'what are you doing, is there a better way?'""I think we have this amazing opportunity to get the world together to talk about ambition but crucially to deliver it, and I guess I am really determined to do that.""Scientists say that to keep the rise in global temperatures under 1.5C this century, a major upgrade is needed on the plans that countries are already applying to the problem.Delivering anything close to that type of deal in Glasgow will depend on a number of key meetings in the run up to COP26.One of the most important is the summit between the President of China, Xi Jinping and EU leaders in Leipzig in September.If the EU can persuade China to put an ambitious new climate plan on the table, it will significantly improve the chances of success in Glasgow.""For China to enhance it's climate targets or not will be primarily a political and diplomatic decision, and that is precisely why the European engagement at the diplomatic level will be critical for us to unlock further climate ambition from Beijing,"" said Li Shuo from Greenpeace China.""But the EU will have to have its own climate plan enhanced before the EU-China summit, and I think that's the only way to make that summit meaningful.""The good news is that the Chinese president is coming and that provides a high level opportunity.""However, many experts are concerned that China won't show its hand until they know who will be the next president of the United States - that election will take place just six days before the meeting in Glasgow opens.To achieve a deal, the UK will need to persuade some of the more reluctant countries like India, Brazil and Australia that it is in their interest to agree to increase their ambitions.Rachel Kyte is now Dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University, but was previously the World Bank's special envoy on climate change.She believes that agreement in Glasgow will need the UK to help shift the narrative - that a new climate deal offers more opportunities for countries than challenges.""This is completely within our means. Most of the technology we need, we have. Most of the finance we have, it's just sloshing around in the economy just really inefficiently purposed at the moment,"" she said.""Governments and leaders need to understand they will be rewarded for being on the right side of history and for taking the risk, and it is one worth taking.""It's an exciting future, it's cleaner, the air will be better - we'll have better jobs, it is not a sacrifice, it is something we owe ourselves.""Follow Matt on Twitter.ShareSaveMatt McGrathEnvironment correspondentSECGetty ImagesIISD/ENB KIARA WORTHClimate change: UK has 'one shot' at success at Glasgow COP2627 January 2020 Share Save Matt McGrath Environment correspondentThe Scottish Events Campus includes the Armadillo and the SSE HydroBBC World Service Discovery - 2020: A year to save the Planet?

16,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51281986,ew84dk,Climate change: Worst emissions scenario 'exceedingly unlikely',"The worst-case scenario for emissions of CO2 this century is no longer plausible, say researchers.Referred to as ""business as usual"", the scenario assumes a 500% increase in the use of coal, which is now considered unlikely.Climate models suggest that this level of carbon could see warming of up to 6C by 2100, with severe impacts.Researchers say that on current trends, a rise in temperatures of around 3C is far more likely.About 10 years ago, ahead of the fifth assessment report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), researchers developed four different scenarios to describe how carbon emissions might change over the rest of this century.One of these clumsily titled ""Representative Concentration Pathways"" (RCPs), was called RCP8.5 and it was intended to show the impact of very high emissions consistent with a five fold increase in the use of coal and virtually no policies to limit CO2 emissions.RCP8.5 was first developed by energy researchers to help with their modelling. According to the authors of this paper, they didn't do a good job of communicating the limitations of this approach to climate scientists who wanted to use it to see what would happen with temperatures.Rather than being seen as something that only had a 3% chance of becoming reality, it became known as the ""business-as-usual"" scenario, by climate scientists and has been used in more than 2,000 research papers since.""What we're arguing is that we've been misusing the worst climate change scenario,"" said author Zeke Hausfather, director of climate and energy at the Breakthrough Institute in California.""Obviously, a lot has changed since 2005 or so when the scenario was created. A lot of clean technology prices have fallen, by factors of five, while global coal use peaked in 2013. And it's been flat since then.""""So what originally was a sort of worst-case (scenario) with less than 10% chance of happening is today, exceedingly unlikely.""This is more about scientific assumptions added to a communications cock-up.Very few scientists realised that RCP8.5 was originally a 90th percentile outcome, not a most likely or business-as-usual outcome. They assumed too much, when they should perhaps have checked, say the authors of the review.""At the end of the day, scientists have to take responsibility for what they choose as input data, and there should be a degree of due diligence,"" said Glen Peters, from the CICERO Center for International Climate Research in Norway.""How many of your average climate scientists know the nuances of RCP8.5? It would certainly be interesting to know.""The media, taking their steer from scientists, have tended to use the highest impacts when reporting on projections based on emissions scenarios.""That's not to say that these highest-end impacts are impossible to happen, but it is not business-as-usual. And that's the point we're really trying to make in this piece.""Not necessarily.This new work questions the chances of very high future emissions because renewable energy is now much cheaper, and competing with coal.So rather than a world that warms by 6C, it should mean that the world will warm by around 3C based on current policies that countries have signed up to.However, the authors are at pains to point out that the lower temperatures aren't guaranteed.That's because scientists are still uncertain as to how sensitive temperatures are to CO2. New models are being used for the next set of major projections due from the IPCC next year. Those models are said to show that temperatures are more sensitive to CO2 than previously thought.There is also the question of climate feedbacks. Although emissions from human activities might level off over this century, warming could see more permafrost melt which will push more methane and CO2 into the air, putting upward pressure on temperatures.""I don't think we can rule out a world of four degrees or above, because of these uncertainties in climate sensitivity and the uncertainties in carbon cycle feedbacks,"" said Zeke Hausfather.""So even under a lower emission scenario, you could have higher sea level rise, higher warming impacts, if climate sensitivity ends up being on the high end.""""If you think of climate as a problem of risk management, you don't necessarily just want to plan for the most likely outcome, You want to plan for sort of the tail risk, the relatively low probability but high impact scenario.""The authors point out that a 3C rise would be a global average and that many parts of the world such as the Arctic would likely warm by much more than that.""You having a world where the coral reefs are largely wiped out at three degrees warming, you're having a world where combined with deforestation, there's a real high risk of the Amazon rainforest turning into more of a savannah type ecosystem in the long run,"" said Zeke Hausfather.Experts believe that at 3C, the Arctic sea-ice would be mostly gone in the summer with devastating consequences. It could cause large scale melting of permafrost, It could destabilise roads and houses in the far north and there's increasing damage to crop yields.""There's a lot of real impacts with three degrees that we can't sweep away. And there's a non-trivial risk that climate sensitivity is four degrees instead of three.""Many people have concerns that if strong action isn't taken to curb emissions, then the cumulative effect of all the impacts of climate change could threaten the future of humanity.""There's never been that much evidence that climate change is going to literally cause the extinction of the human race,"" said Zeke Hausfather.""But there's a lot of things in the world that are less bad than literal extinction that we want to avoid at all costs.""Yes - it shows that even the limited attempts to cut carbon that the world has adopted to date are having an impact and the worst emissions scenarios are no longer realistic.While a world that warms by 3C is a disaster, the progress that's been made should encourage people to aim for higher targets to try to keep the world to 1.5C of warming, which science suggests is a much safer threshold.""In many ways this is a success story. It's not where we want to get it's not meeting the Paris agreement targets of limiting warming to below 2C, but the world has taken some action and clean energy has gotten cheaper,"" said Zeke Hausfather.""And as that happens, we're necessarily going to move away from some of the worst case possible outcomes. The more climate policies countries enact, the more we're going to sort of head toward a world of two to three degrees warming, hopefully on the two side, and hopefully below two, but that requires a lot more political effort.""The commentary has been published in the journal Nature.Follow Matt on Twitter.ShareSaveMatt McGrathEnvironment correspondentGetty ImagesClimate change: Worst emissions scenario 'exceedingly unlikely'29 January 2020 Share Save Matt McGrath Environment correspondentThe falling cost of renewable energy is making the most extreme emissions scenario much less likelyHow has this confusion come about?Coal fired power stations like this one in Schkopau, Germany face an uncertain futureDoes this mean that climate scientists have been exaggerating the threat?Does this mean that our projections about future temperature rises are wrong?The melting of Arctic ice could speed up the warming of the worldWhat does a world that warms by 3C look like?Researchers say that wildfires, like the recent ones in Australia, are more likely in a world that warms by 3CDoes this review mean human extinction is less likely from climate change?Is this good news in some ways?"
17,https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2020/01/31/massachusetts-senate-approves-net-zero-environmental-bills,ewt8n8,Massachusetts Senate approves 'net-zero' environmental bills,"By STEVE LeBLANC, Associated PressBOSTON (AP) — The Massachusetts Senate approved a series of bills Thursday that supporters say will help dramatically reduce the state’s greenhouse gas emissions over the next few decades.POLICYThe package of bills envisions transitioning cars, trucks and buses to carbon-free electric power, jump-starting efforts to supply low-cost solar electricity to low-income communities, and requiring appliances meet energy efficiency standards.Supporters say they’re aiming for a statewide “net zero” emissions greenhouse gas limit for the year 2050.Democratic state Sen. Marc Pacheco said Massachusetts is starting to fall behind other states which have passed aggressive carbon emissions standards.He said it’s urgent that states take action, even if individually they account for a relatively small part of the problem.“Would you drive your car into your garage with the engine running and stay in that garage?” Pacheco said. “We are in a big garage. The world is in a big garage.”The bills would set a deadline for converting all Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority buses to all-electric power by requiring the MBTA to limit bus purchases and leases to zero-emission vehicles beginning in 2030, and to aim for an all zero-emissions fleet by 2040.State government would be limited to buying or leasing zero emissions vehicles beginning in 2024. The bills would provide rebates or other financial incentives to consumers who buy or lease a zero-emission vehicle.To reach the 2050 net-zero goal, the legislation requires the state to hit near-term carbon limits in 2025, 2030 and every five years after that. The bill also sets separate sub-limits for transportation, buildings, solid waste, natural gas distribution and other major sectors.Critics say the Senate bills don’t take into consideration the financial impact on small businesses, consumers, drivers and others in Massachusetts. They said those impacts could come in the form of higher energy bills, higher fuel prices, more expensive products, and limits on what consumers can buy or install in their homes or what companies can sell.“Shoppers living within a budget may not be able to buy and install a more affordable product from another state, or even purchase a used appliance,” said Christopher Carlozzi, state director for the National Federation of Independent Businesses.“The potential carbon taxes would make the state’s small businesses uncompetitive with companies in states with lower energy costs,” Carlozzi added.Ben Hellerstein, state director for Environment Massachusetts, praised the efficiency standards for new faucets, shower heads, commercial dishwashers, ovens, and other products.“By reducing the amount of unnecessary energy wasted by common products, we can take a big bite out of pollution,” he said.Supporters of the bills say they will also help counter efforts by the Republican administration of President Donald Trump to slow the progress of energy-efficient appliances by updating the state’s own appliance standards to improve energy and water standards for household and commercial appliances.Existing Massachusetts law — the 2008 Global Warming Solutions Act — set a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 80% below 1990 levels by the year 2050. The package of bills would effectively set a goal of 100% below 1990 levels.The bills would give the governor and his successors the ability to choose among various market based forms of carbon pricing — including a revenue-neutral fee or a regional “cap and trade” system — to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.The bills would also require the state Department of Energy Resources to set aside future solar allocations for low-income neighborhoods and let the state support cities and towns that choose to move away from fossil fuels as the source of heating for new buildings.A new Massachusetts Climate Policy Commission would also be created to offer a “nonpartisan, science-based view” of the problem as it plays out in Massachusetts.Republican Gov. Charlie Baker has said he’s committed to achieving a climate goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.Democratic House Speaker Robert DeLeo said last week that the House will also be supporting the net-zero goal.The Senate bills now head to the House.Boston.comLOCAL NEWS3 minutes to readFacebookTwitterEmailThe Mass.

Photo by Rob Deutscher/FlickrGetting to a net-zero-carbon energy system is essential. It will be a major effort, one that requires significant investment in new low-carbon infrastructure, from renewable power plants to electric vehicles, efficient appliances and better constructed buildings. While very few countries are on track, China, Costa Rica, Denmark, Ethiopia and the United Kingdom are further along than many others.These countries are all over the globe at all levels of development. Some arrived where they are by intent; others were helped by geography or history. Yet they all reveal lessons about the net-zero emissions transition needed in all countries to avert the worst impacts of climate change.Energy production and use accounts for about three-quarters of global greenhouse gas emissions, making it the most important element of a net-zero emissions strategy for many countries. Three main strategies can help countries meet energy needs with zero-carbon emissions: optimize, electrify and decarbonize. Essentially, all countries need to:These strategies are needed in all the major energy-using sectors ‒ buildings, transportation and industry ‒ as well as in the power system.Some countries are further along on these three strategies than others, as indicated by their improvements in energy intensity, degree of electrification of energy use, and portion of their electricity that comes from zero-carbon sources. China, Costa Rica, Denmark, Ethiopia and the United Kingdom have some of the best scores on these indicators in the most recent available data, or have made significant progress over the past few decades on two or more indicators.Energy intensity improvement (% decrease in energy use per unit of economic product — MJ/GDP PPP)Electricity as portion of final energy consumption (%)*Generation from zero carbon sources of electricity**, as % of all electricity generationCountryAnnual rate of change (1990-2000)Annual rate of change (2010-2016)Change in rate of change between 1990-2000 & 2010-20162017Change between 1990 and 20177.1%4.7%-2.4%6%24%18%19%28%-0.6%2.1%2.7%22%3%98%1.9%3.9%2.0%20%55%53%-0.5%6.0%6.5%88%100%12%1.6%4.1%2.5%23%45%OECD TotalN/A39%40%Non-OECD Total10%30%-2%World1.5%2.3%0.8%15%36%33%-3%* Limited to consumption by industrial, transportation and building sectors – agriculture, non-energy fuel consumption and other miscellaneous uses excluded. ** Nuclear, hydro, geothermal, solar PV, solar thermal, wind, tide Sources: Energy intensity – https://trackingsdg7.esmap.org/ ; Electricity consumption and energy consumption by sector, electricity sources – https://www.iea.org/statistics/These indicators alone do not tell the whole story of a country’s decarbonization path and needs, but because comparable data is available for all countries through the IEA and the World Bank, they make it possible to assess all countries in a consistent way. And because these are relative (percentage) indicators rather than direct measures of absolute emissions, countries’ energy-related emissions could still be rising even as they improve on these metrics. This is currently the case for most rapidly growing economies ‒ where energy demand is growing significantly ‒ but not for many developed economies, where economic growth, energy use and emissions are decoupling. To achieve net-zero emissions, the improvements in these metrics in all countries will need to be large enough to overcome growing demand for energy services.There are at least six important factors behind these countries’ decarbonization:1. Investments in energy efficiency: China, Denmark, Ethiopia and the UK have all decreased their energy intensity at an annual rate of 4% or better in recent years, a rate significantly above the global average of 2.3%. This indicates that they are improving the energy efficiency of their economies and reducing energy demand. China, Denmark and the UK have all set energy efficiency targets and implemented a comprehensive suite of policies and investment programs to increase energy efficiency.2. Hydropower: In Costa Rica and Ethiopia, which get almost all their electricity from clean sources, hydropower has been the majority of generation from 1990 to the present. These original investments in hydropower were made before widespread concern for reducing carbon emissions, so the decisions were likely based primarily on the economics of harnessing low-cost, locally available resources. But these aren’t just legacy systems; both countries have invested in additional hydropower capacity as electricity demand has grown. Hydropower is similarly important in electricity systems in Brazil, Colombia and Kenya, which are also close to zero-carbon. Meanwhile, developing countries as a whole only get an average of 28% of their electricity from zero-carbon sources.3. Investment in non-hydro renewables: Many countries’ progress on electricity decarbonization is being driven by investment in wind, solar photovoltaics and geothermal. Costa Rica, Demark and the UK all went from getting virtually none of their power from non-hydro renewables in 1990 to 20% or more by 2017. Kenya has also grown its capacity considerably, particularly geothermal. China’s renewables growth has been small as a percentage of its electricity needs, but huge in absolute terms, as it is now the largest market for solar and wind in the world.Meanwhile, global progress on clean electricity has stalled, with the share of zero-carbon sources basically stuck at 30-35% since 1990. The past few years have shown an uptick in the zero-carbon share ‒ mostly coming from new wind and solar, while the share of nuclear and hydro is shrinking ‒ but progress remains slow compared to the urgency of getting to zero.4. Growing wealth and economic modernization correlate with electrification of the energy sector: China is among the countries with the strongest growth in and highest share of electricity use compared to total energy consumption. Nearly a quarter of its energy consumption is now electricity, as opposed to other energy forms like direct consumption of fossil fuels like natural gas or oil, up from only 6% in 1990. Growth in the electricity share of energy can be seen in other countries that have experienced rapid economic growth and modernization, including India, Indonesia, Mexico, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. Overall, electrification levels in other countries have been changing very slowly, with the global average moving from 15% to 20% since 1990, driven mainly by developing countries. Addressing this slow pace and making sure that electrification is reaching all end uses within each sector is imperative for decarbonization.5. Building electrification has been significant; transportation has lagged: Electrification by sector varies considerably. By far the greatest electricity market share and growth is in the buildings sector, in both residential and services buildings. Globally, electricity increased its market share from 19% of all building energy consumption in 1990 to 31% in 2017. The growth has been greatest in emerging economies (Brazil, China, Costa Rica, India and Indonesia), while lower-income countries and developed economies generally experienced less change. This correlates with the growth of consumer classes in emerging economies and their purchasing of more electric equipment and appliances, such as lighting, fans and air conditioners, and a smaller portion of households using firewood or other traditional biomass fuels. The services sector ‒ which is more electrified in general ‒ also grew in these economies.In contrast, transportation is only around 0-1% electrified in most countries and has shown very little change over the past three decades. China is the only notable exception, nudging up to 3.4% from 1.6% over this time period. This makes sense, as China is also the leader for electric vehicles, but even it has a long way to go to a fully electrified transportation sector. While the pace of change in transportation may be quickening now, this is only partially reflected in the most recent data from 2017.6. Direct commitments to clean, efficient energy and decarbonization: Costa Rica, Denmark and the UK have all set economy-wide net-zero emissions targets for 2050. These commitments to full decarbonization build upon the decades of efforts that these countries have already made toward energy efficiency, renewable energy and sustainable development. More countries should follow their lead in setting explicit decarbonization targets.Some countries are positioned particularly well for decarbonization. But that doesn’t mean that other countries can’t also lead, even if they haven’t yet built as strong a foundation through previous actions. By learning from the leaders, all countries can chart a course to a zero-carbon future.Explore more Optimize, Electrify, Decarbonize data on Resource Watch.This blog was originally published on WRI’s Insights.Eric Mackres is the Data and Tools Manager for Urban Efficiency & Climate at WRI Ross Center for Sustainable Cities.This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License.Stay up to DateShare on FacebookReduce energy use through improved efficiency (optimize);Shift energy demand to electricity and away from combustion of fossil fuels (electrify); andShift entirely to zero-carbon technologies to generate electricity (decarbonize).Advanced SearchAny thoughts on updates on this or links to updated versions?

These countries are all over the globe at all levels of development. Some arrived where they are by intent; others were helped by geography or history. Yet they all reveal lessons about the net-zero emissions transition needed in all countries to avert the worst impacts of climate change. How Can Countries Achieve Zero-Carbon Energy? Energy production and use accounts for about three-quarters of global greenhouse gas emissions, making it the most important element of a net-zero emissions strategy for many countries. Three main strategies can help countries meet energy needs with zero-carbon emissions: optimize, electrify and decarbonize. Essentially, all countries need to: Reduce energy use through improved efficiency (optimize); Shift energy demand to electricity and away from combustion of fossil fuels (electrify); and Shift entirely to zero-carbon technologies to generate electricity (decarbonize). These strategies are needed in all the major energy-using sectors ‒ buildings, transportation and industry ‒ as well as in the power system. Some countries are further along on these three strategies than others, as indicated by their improvements in energy intensity, degree of electrification of energy use, and portion of their electricity that comes from zero-carbon sources. China, Costa Rica, Denmark, Ethiopia and the United Kingdom have some of the best scores on these indicators in the most recent available data, or have made significant progress over the past few decades on two or more indicators. Optimize Electrify Decarbonize Energy intensity improvement (% decrease in energy use per unit of economic product — MJ/GDP PPP) Electricity as portion of final energy consumption (%)* Generation from zero carbon sources of electricity**, as % of all electricity generation Country Annual rate of change (1990-2000) Annual rate of change (2010-2016) Change in rate of change between 1990-2000 & 2010-2016 1990 2017 Change between 1990 and 2017 1990 2017 Change between 1990 and 2017 China 7.1% 4.7% -2.4% 6% 24% 18% 19% 28% 9% Costa Rica -0.6% 2.1% 2.7% 19% 22% 3% 98% 98% 1% Denmark 1.9% 3.9% 2.0% 19% 20% 0% 2% 55% 53% Ethiopia -0.5% 6.0% 6.5% 0% 2% 2% 88% 100% 12% United Kingdom 1.6% 4.1% 2.5% 19% 22% 3% 23% 45% 22% OECD Total N/A N/A N/A 20% 24% 4% 39% 40% 1% Non-OECD Total N/A N/A N/A 10% 19% 9% 30% 28% -2% World 1.5% 2.3% 0.8% 15% 20% 5% 36% 33% -3% * Limited to consumption by industrial, transportation and building sectors – agriculture, non-energy fuel consumption and other miscellaneous uses excluded. ** Nuclear, hydro, geothermal, solar PV, solar thermal, wind, tide Sources: Energy intensity – https://trackingsdg7.esmap.org/ ; Electricity consumption and energy consumption by sector, electricity sources – https://www.iea.org/statistics/ These indicators alone do not tell the whole story of a country’s decarbonization path and needs, but because comparable data is available for all countries through the IEA and the World Bank, they make it possible to assess all countries in a consistent way. And because these are relative (percentage) indicators rather than direct measures of absolute emissions, countries’ energy-related emissions could still be rising even as they improve on these metrics. This is currently the case for most rapidly growing economies ‒ where energy demand is growing significantly ‒ but not for many developed economies, where economic growth, energy use and emissions are decoupling. To achieve net-zero emissions, the improvements in these metrics in all countries will need to be large enough to overcome growing demand for energy services. How Are Countries Decarbonizing Their Energy Systems? There are at least six important factors behind these countries’ decarbonization: 1. Investments in energy efficiency: China, Denmark, Ethiopia and the UK have all decreased their energy intensity at an annual rate of 4% or better in recent years, a rate significantly above the global average of 2.3%. This indicates that they are improving the energy efficiency of their economies and reducing energy demand. China, Denmark and the UK have all set energy efficiency targets and implemented a comprehensive suite of policies and investment programs to increase energy efficiency. 2. Hydropower: In Costa Rica and Ethiopia, which get almost all their electricity from clean sources, hydropower has been the majority of generation from 1990 to the present. These original investments in hydropower were made before widespread concern for reducing carbon emissions, so the decisions were likely based primarily on the economics of harnessing low-cost, locally available resources. But these aren’t just legacy systems; both countries have invested in additional hydropower capacity as electricity demand has grown. Hydropower is similarly important in electricity systems in Brazil, Colombia and Kenya, which are also close to zero-carbon. Meanwhile, developing countries as a whole only get an average of 28% of their electricity from zero-carbon sources. 3. Investment in non-hydro renewables: Many countries’ progress on electricity decarbonization is being driven by investment in wind, solar photovoltaics and geothermal. Costa Rica, Demark and the UK all went from getting virtually none of their power from non-hydro renewables in 1990 to 20% or more by 2017. Kenya has also grown its capacity considerably, particularly geothermal. China’s renewables growth has been small as a percentage of its electricity needs, but huge in absolute terms, as it is now the largest market for solar and wind in the world. Meanwhile, global progress on clean electricity has stalled, with the share of zero-carbon sources basically stuck at 30-35% since 1990. The past few years have shown an uptick in the zero-carbon share ‒ mostly coming from new wind and solar, while the share of nuclear and hydro is shrinking ‒ but progress remains slow compared to the urgency of getting to zero. 4. Growing wealth and economic modernization correlate with electrification of the energy sector: China is among the countries with the strongest growth in and highest share of electricity use compared to total energy consumption. Nearly a quarter of its energy consumption is now electricity, as opposed to other energy forms like direct consumption of fossil fuels like natural gas or oil, up from only 6% in 1990. Growth in the electricity share of energy can be seen in other countries that have experienced rapid economic growth and modernization, including India, Indonesia, Mexico, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. Overall, electrification levels in other countries have been changing very slowly, with the global average moving from 15% to 20% since 1990, driven mainly by developing countries. Addressing this slow pace and making sure that electrification is reaching all end uses within each sector is imperative for decarbonization. 5. Building electrification has been significant; transportation has lagged: Electrification by sector varies considerably. By far the greatest electricity market share and growth is in the buildings sector, in both residential and services buildings. Globally, electricity increased its market share from 19% of all building energy consumption in 1990 to 31% in 2017. The growth has been greatest in emerging economies (Brazil, China, Costa Rica, India and Indonesia), while lower-income countries and developed economies generally experienced less change. This correlates with the growth of consumer classes in emerging economies and their purchasing of more electric equipment and appliances, such as lighting, fans and air conditioners, and a smaller portion of households using firewood or other traditional biomass fuels. The services sector ‒ which is more electrified in general ‒ also grew in these economies. In contrast, transportation is only around 0-1% electrified in most countries and has shown very little change over the past three decades. China is the only notable exception, nudging up to 3.4% from 1.6% over this time period. This makes sense, as China is also the leader for electric vehicles, but even it has a long way to go to a fully electrified transportation sector. While the pace of change in transportation may be quickening now, this is only partially reflected in the most recent data from 2017.

Direct commitments to clean, efficient energy and decarbonization: Costa Rica, Denmark and the UK have all set economy-wide net-zero emissions targets for 2050. These commitments to full decarbonization build upon the decades of efforts that these countries have already made toward energy efficiency, renewable energy and sustainable development. More countries should follow their lead in setting explicit decarbonization targets. Getting Onto a Pathway for Decarbonization Some countries are positioned particularly well for decarbonization. But that doesn’t mean that other countries can’t also lead, even if they haven’t yet built as strong a foundation through previous actions. By learning from the leaders, all countries can chart a course to a zero-carbon future. Explore more Optimize, Electrify, Decarbonize data on Resource Watch.

This is great, but all those trees will mean nothing if they aren’t part of a broader strategy to revive the planet’s struggling ecosystems.This story is cross-posted on Viewpoints, the Forest Trends Blog.31 January 2020| The world is rallying around planting trees for climate action. Even President Donald Trump is on board, announcing last week at the World Economic Forum that the US would join the One Trillion Trees Initiative.In the next ten years, you will likely see the largest effort in history to regreen the planet. The United Nations has declared 2021-2030 the Decade on Ecological Restoration. Initiatives including the Bonn Challenge, the African Forest Landscape Restoration Initiative, and dozens of corporate and government commitments will replant, restore, and preserve hundreds of millions of acres of land around the world.These efforts contribute to keeping global warming under 1.5° C. Climate scientists have shown that reducing emissions is no longer enough to stay below this threshold. We need negative emissions – to actively remove carbon from the atmosphere in addition to our already-planned emissions cuts.Investing in natural carbon sinks like forests is our best – and currently our only – strategy for affordable carbon removal. Natural climate solutions like restoring and preserving forests and other high-carbon ecosystems, switching to climate-friendly agriculture, and practicing sustainable forest management can cost-effectively achieve more than 37% of the emissions reductions we need to stay under 1.5° C.It’s important to point out that tree-planting is not our only natural climate strategy. A major new study released this week shows that protecting existing tropical forests is still the largest pathway we have for cost-effectively mitigating emissions.Nor can we forget that history is littered with failed tree-planting projects. China, home to some of the world’s largest reforestation campaigns in history, lost as many as 86% of trees planted between 1952-2005. Millions of trees have been planted in the Sahara since the 1980s, but it still isn’t green.How do we make sure this tree-planting movement is different? Forest Trends has worked for nearly two decades in the Amazon planting trees as part of larger agroforestry and forest management systems developed hand-in-hand with indigenous peoples. Here are some basic guiding principles for making smart investments in forests that we’ve learned.When forests and other ecosystems are damaged, they take decades or even centuries to fully recover, if they ever do. For that reason, it is vitally important right now to protect existing forests and healthy working forest lands than to plant new trees. The best way to maximize carbon sequestration, water filtration, flood regulation, wildlife habitat, and the other benefits trees give us is to keep existing forests healthy and intact. Then, we can build on this foundation through wise restoration and reforestation efforts.Many tree-planting efforts fail or have unintended consequences because they create forests where forests didn’t exist before – for example in grasslands and arid areas. You also need good science to understand how ecological functions interact or pose trade-offs. For example, planting trees can reduce local river flows (at least initially) but sometimes has the opposite effect during the dry season. And the outcome depends a lot on previous land uses (for instance if the land was previously plowed for farming), degree of soil disturbance, and the eco-region we’re working in. Meanwhile, planting non-native species can hurt biodiversity.For reasons like these, projects need to take a whole-ecosystem approach. When we think about forests here at Forest Trends, we see them inherently multifunctional: a virtual (supermarket) of products and services. With a single conservation investment in a forest, you can sequester carbon, purify water, recharge aquifers, absorb floodwaters, provide a home for wildlife, and ensure a sustainable supply of wood fiber, food, and other products for people. When we plant trees and maintain forests, we need to capture and monitor these other services (carbon, water, biodiversity) and drive our economic system to value these precious assets.“There is a saying in forestry: It is not about trees, it is about people,” Nestor Gregorio, a research fellow at Australia’s University of the Sunshine Coast, told the Washington Post. “If people will find trees important, then they will look after the trees.”It’s like birthing and successfully rearing a child.

We are seeing more novel ecosystems, and we can’t rely on the past for much guidance on how our restored and newly planted forests are going to behave.

This is great, but all those trees will mean nothing if they aren’t part of a broader strategy to revive the planet’s struggling ecosystems. This story is cross-posted on Viewpoints, the Forest Trends Blog. 31 January 2020| The world is rallying around planting trees for climate action. Even President Donald Trump is on board, announcing last week at the World Economic Forum that the US would join the One Trillion Trees Initiative. In the next ten years, you will likely see the largest effort in history to regreen the planet. The United Nations has declared 2021-2030 the Decade on Ecological Restoration. Initiatives including the Bonn Challenge, the African Forest Landscape Restoration Initiative, and dozens of corporate and government commitments will replant, restore, and preserve hundreds of millions of acres of land around the world. These efforts contribute to keeping global warming under 1.5° C. Climate scientists have shown that reducing emissions is no longer enough to stay below this threshold. We need negative emissions – to actively remove carbon from the atmosphere in addition to our already-planned emissions cuts. Investing in natural carbon sinks like forests is our best – and currently our only – strategy for affordable carbon removal. Natural climate solutions like restoring and preserving forests and other high-carbon ecosystems, switching to climate-friendly agriculture, and practicing sustainable forest management can cost-effectively achieve more than 37% of the emissions reductions we need to stay under 1.5° C. It’s important to point out that tree-planting is not our only natural climate strategy. A major new study released this week shows that protecting existing tropical forests is still the largest pathway we have for cost-effectively mitigating emissions. Nor can we forget that history is littered with failed tree-planting projects. China, home to some of the world’s largest reforestation campaigns in history, lost as many as 86% of trees planted between 1952-2005. Millions of trees have been planted in the Sahara since the 1980s, but it still isn’t green. How do we make sure this tree-planting movement is different? Forest Trends has worked for nearly two decades in the Amazon planting trees as part of larger agroforestry and forest management systems developed hand-in-hand with indigenous peoples. Here are some basic guiding principles for making smart investments in forests that we’ve learned. Learn to think at the speed of a tree, the breath of a forest. When forests and other ecosystems are damaged, they take decades or even centuries to fully recover, if they ever do. For that reason, it is vitally important right now to protect existing forests and healthy working forest lands than to plant new trees. The best way to maximize carbon sequestration, water filtration, flood regulation, wildlife habitat, and the other benefits trees give us is to keep existing forests healthy and intact. Then, we can build on this foundation through wise restoration and reforestation efforts. Plant the right species in the right place, and that remember a forest is more than just a stand of trees. Many tree-planting efforts fail or have unintended consequences because they create forests where forests didn’t exist before – for example in grasslands and arid areas. You also need good science to understand how ecological functions interact or pose trade-offs. For example, planting trees can reduce local river flows (at least initially) but sometimes has the opposite effect during the dry season. And the outcome depends a lot on previous land uses (for instance if the land was previously plowed for farming), degree of soil disturbance, and the eco-region we’re working in.

When we plant trees and maintain forests, we need to capture and monitor these other services (carbon, water, biodiversity) and drive our economic system to value these precious assets. Partner with local communities to ensure that seedlings survive and communities benefit from projects. “There is a saying in forestry: It is not about trees, it is about people,” Nestor Gregorio, a research fellow at Australia’s University of the Sunshine Coast, told the Washington Post. “If people will find trees important, then they will look after the trees.” It’s like birthing and successfully rearing a child.

We have seen that supporting indigenous and forest communities to thrive in their homelands is one of the most effective safeguards against forest loss. But these communities need effective partnerships to keep their forests standing. They also need support in creating sustainable economic enterprises that provide alternatives to deforestation. Be humble. We are changing global ecosystems so drastically (the Amazon forests may soon ‘tip over’ into savannah thanks to climate change and mega-scale conversion to agricultural production; some ecosystems may never recover in the Australian bush after this winter’s fires) that the analogs we have used to understand system change in the past no longer apply.

Dismissed a decade ago as far-fetched and dangerous, schemes to tame global warming by engineering the climate have migrated from the margins of policy debates towards center stage.“Plan A” remains tackling the problem at its source. But the UN's top climate science body has made it clear that slashing carbon pollution won't be enough to keep Earth from overheating.That has opened the door to a host of geoengineering schemes, and an under-the-radar set of global industry guidelines, currently in review, which could help mainstream them.Here is a menu of “Plan B” geoengineering solutions, and their potential drawbacks:Direct CO2 captureExperiments have shown it is possible to suck planet-warming carbon dioxide directly from the air, converting it into fuel pellets or storing it underground.A Canadian company backed by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates launched a pilot facility in Canada in 2015, and another company unveiled one in Iceland last year.Drawback: The technology is currently prohibitively expensive and may take decades to operate at scale.AfforestationExtensive planting of trees could significantly slow the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, which currently stands at more than 410 parts per million, 40 percent more than 150 years ago.Drawback: Even if deforestation could be reversed – more than 100,000 square kilometers of tropical forests have disappeared each year since 2013 – the number of trees needed to put a dent in CO2 emissions would clash with food and biofuel crops.BECCSBioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) marries a natural process with a high-tech one.The first step is to plant rapeseed, sugarcane, corn or “2nd-generation” biofuel crops such as switchgrass, which pull CO2 from the air while growing.The second step is while burning the harvested plants for energy to sequester the CO2 produced.In theory, the result is less CO2 in the atmosphere than when the process started. Virtually all climate change models projecting a future consistent with the Paris Agreement's temperature targets assume a key role for BECCS.Drawback: Studies calculate that up to twice the area of India would need to be given over to biofuels, putting BECCS in conflict with food crops.Ocean fertilizationMicroscopic ocean plants called phytoplankton gobble up CO2 and drag it to the bottom of the ocean when they die. Their colony size is limited by a lack of natural iron, but experiments have shown that sowing the ocean with iron sulphate powder creates large blooms.Drawbacks: Scientists worry about unintended impacts. Die-offs of plankton, for example, use up oxygen, which could create massive “dead zones” in the oceans, something already on the rise.Enhanced weatheringNatural weathering of rocks removes about one billion tons of CO2 from the atmosphere every year –about two percent of total man-made CO2 emissions.Spreading a powdered form of a greenish iron silicate called olivine across certain landscapes can mimic that process, experiments have shown.Drawbacks: It would be expensive to mine and mill enough olivine to make a difference.BiocharBiochar is charcoal made by heating plant waste – rice straw, peanut shells, wood scraps – over long periods in low-oxygen conditions. It can store CO2 for long periods, and also enriches soil.Drawback: The scientific jury is still out on how quickly this method could be scaled up, and on the stability of biochar used as a fertilizer.Solar radiation managementUnlike other strategies, solar radiation management does not target CO2.The goal is simple: prevent some of the sun's rays from hitting the planet's surface, forcing them back up into space. Some serious scientific mojo has been applied to this idea at universities around the world. Harvard’s solar geoengineering research program is a research initiative devoted entirely to the science, technology and public policy of solar geoengineering. But too few scientists and too little funding have been applied to this solution which is sad since it doesn’t need much.There are several technologies for this approach. One idea is to inject or spray tiny reflective particles into the stratosphere – possibly with balloons, aircraft or through giant tubes.Nature sometimes does the same: Debris from the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines lowered the planet's average surface temperature for a year or two afterwards.Scientists have also calculated ways to alter clouds that could help beat the heat.Drawbacks: Even if it works as intended, solar radiation management would do nothing to reduce atmospheric CO2, which is making oceans too acidic. There is also the danger of knock-on consequences, including changes in rainfall patterns, and what scientists call “termination shock” – a sudden warming if the system were to fail. Solar geoengineering is not to be done, or even considered, as a replacement for cutting carbon emissions. It’s just to buy us the several decades we need to actually cut emissions to near zero without frying the planet. This is because solar geoengineering cannot eliminate all of the damages caused by green-house gas-driven warming, even if it tried to restore global average temperatures to pre-industrial levels.Similar to genetic engineering, geoengineering is not a final solution, nor an easy fix. It would be best understood as a complement to ongoing decarbonization efforts—but only once the reliability, scalability, and acceptability issues have been resolved. Using the moral hazard framework is a distraction from the more fundamental ethical challenges facing these technologies./ Renewables/ Friday, 31 January 2020 13:03TagsEnergy & PowerTechnology & Smart CitiesPolicy & RegulationsENERGYFINANCIAL NEWSOIL & GASRENEWABLEAll Rights Reserved © 2025What “Plan B” do we have for the planet? / Renewables / Friday, 31 January 2020 13:03 Desperate times call for desperate measures.

The American Polluter in Chief was kind enough to drop a little reminder into the State of the Union this week. We’re going to protect the environment, Trump told Congress and the nation. And (and!) we’re going to do it by … helping plant a trillion trees.“To protect the environment, days ago I announced that the United States will join the One Trillion Trees Initiative, an ambitious effort to bring together government and private sector to plant new trees in America and all around the world,” Trump said on Tuesday.Coming from this President, that’s near-nonsense.Yes, it’s true that trees take carbon out of the air, and therefore planting trees and protecting rainforests truly are important tools in the effort to clean up the atmosphere.And, yes, there is a notable (if flawed, and we’ll get to that shortly) global effort to plant one trillion trees in response to the climate emergency.But no, you cannot at once abandon the Paris Agreement (a global effort to fight climate change), promote fossil fuels, pander to coal, as Trump has – and hope to be seen as Climate Jesus by hawking the idea of planting trees.RELATED ARTICLE Shouting into the apocalypse: The decade in climate changeConsider a pub metaphor from Jonathan Foley. He is executive director of Project Drawdown, a group that has quantified solutions to the climate crisis (none of which, as he has told me, is a silver bullet, but 100 of which, all together, add up to something like “silver buckshot”). Imagine you saw someone sitting at a bar and slowly spilling beer on the floor, Foley said. You could grab a mop to try to start cleaning it up, but you wouldn’t get very far unless you also stopped the spill.That’s sort of like the climate. Except we’re spilling something like 37 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere per year, and we’ve been doing it for decades.We need the mop. But how about we stop the spill?“Stopping pollution is the first and best thing we can do,” Foley told me. “Having trees gobble (the pollution) up over the next few decades is the next thing that you do.“We’ve got to do everything, but you need to stop the pollution first.”Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg has summed this up diplomatically.RELATED ARTICLE Trump's gutting of environmental rules is pushing us back into dark days of ignorance“Planting trees is good, of course, but it’s nowhere near enough of what needs to be done, and it cannot replace real mitigation or rewilding nature,” she said during the World Economic Forum, the meeting where Trump announced he would join the trees initiative.“You can’t drill primary forest for oil and gas with your left hand while planting trees with your right,” Sean DeWitt, director of the Global Restoration Initiative at the World Resources Institute, an environmental advocacy and research group, told me.Trump isn’t exactly leading the trillion-trees push, either.Marc Benioff, the Salesforce CEO, Jane Goodall and Al Gore – reputable, prominent environmentalists, all of them – are on board. The World Economic Form launched a website, 1t.org, that intends to aggregate several efforts. The idea gained momentum after a study in the journal Science indicated that increasing forest cover could substantially reduce the amount of carbon that builds up in the atmosphere.Congressman Bruce Westerman, a Republican from Arkansas, released a statement this week saying he is working on legislation that would call for the planting of 1 trillion trees by 2050, “with the goal of sequestering carbon and incentivizing the use of wood products.”“This would benefit both southwest Arkansas’ and the country’s thriving forest industries, as well as change the mindset of future generations regarding environmental stewardship,” the statement says.RELATED ARTICLE My family saw a neighborhood get paved over. Don't let it happen againTo be fair, I’d understand the inclination to give Trump and the Republicans credit here for joining in.There are two problems with that thinking, however.The first, as I’ve mentioned, is the degree to which Donald Trump, while claiming to be an environmentalist, has used his stature both in the media and as the President to promote the idea that climate science is bunk (it isn’t; for decades, scientists have examined the evidence and agreed that humans are causing dangerous warming by burning fossil fuels) and to back the fossil fuel industry.I’m sympathetic to fossil fuel industry workers who are caught in a moment of painful transition as coal, oil and natural gas jobs are phased out for cleaner sources of electricity, like wind and solar. The workers are not the problem, and they deserve our understanding and support. But those fuels need to be all but eliminated by 2050 if we’re to meet international climate goals.Not meeting those goals, meanwhile, means more of the horrors we’re seeing all around the world – mega fires in Australia, super damaging hurricanes in the Atlantic, drought-flood cycles in India. It’s a dangerous, expensive and deeply unjust world we’re creating. And Trump’s is the loudest voice in the “nah, no biggie” camp.The second problem is that the math behind the trillion-trees idea has come under scrutiny.I’ll spare you the details, which were outlined in a smart article in Wired, but researchers in the journal Science have been going back and forth over how much carbon those trees actually will pull out of the atmosphere, how many of them actually can be planted (and where) what happens to people in those places, and how long it will take for those trees to vacuum up carbon.A 2019 estimate in Science of how much carbon the trees actually could absorb, which grabbed lots of public and scientific attention, “was much too high,” said Carla Staver, an associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Yale University. It gave the erroneous impression that trees could be the silver bullet needed to solve the climate crisis, she said.“I understand the appeal of this,” Staver told me. “It is a much less difficult solution to climate change if it were to indeed work… Where it becomes insidious and problematic is that we have good evidence that it won’t work, and that it’s a distraction from the things that will work, (such as) making difficult decisions to cut emissions.”At best, it takes decades for the trees to be effective, said Foley, from Project Drawdown. That’s because trees grow slowly, amassing carbon in their structures as they grow.Trees should be part of the solution, Foley said.It’s bizarre – and hypocritical – to see this environmentalist pose coming from Trump.Planting trees is “100% necessary, because we know that we need to pull carbon out of the atmosphere, not just reduce our emissions,” said DeWitt, from the World Resources Institute. “It’s commendable if it’s done appropriately. And — it’s grossly insufficient on its own. It has to be paired with sound conservation. It has to be part of an overall menu (of climate solutions) that includes decarbonization of our energy systems and transportation systems.”Silver buckshot, not silver bullet.Yes, we need to mop pollution out of the atmosphere.But, first, the spill.Donald Trump vs. climate change 07:02Editor’s Note: John D.

Congressman Bruce Westerman, a Republican from Arkansas, released a statement this week saying he is working on legislation that would call for the planting of 1 trillion trees by 2050, “with the goal of sequestering carbon and incentivizing the use of wood products.” “This would benefit both southwest Arkansas’ and the country’s thriving forest industries, as well as change the mindset of future generations regarding environmental stewardship,” the statement says. RELATED ARTICLE My family saw a neighborhood get paved over. Don't let it happen again To be fair, I’d understand the inclination to give Trump and the Republicans credit here for joining in. There are two problems with that thinking, however. The first, as I’ve mentioned, is the degree to which Donald Trump, while claiming to be an environmentalist, has used his stature both in the media and as the President to promote the idea that climate science is bunk (it isn’t; for decades, scientists have examined the evidence and agreed that humans are causing dangerous warming by burning fossil fuels) and to back the fossil fuel industry. I’m sympathetic to fossil fuel industry workers who are caught in a moment of painful transition as coal, oil and natural gas jobs are phased out for cleaner sources of electricity, like wind and solar. The workers are not the problem, and they deserve our understanding and support. But those fuels need to be all but eliminated by 2050 if we’re to meet international climate goals. Not meeting those goals, meanwhile, means more of the horrors we’re seeing all around the world – mega fires in Australia, super damaging hurricanes in the Atlantic, drought-flood cycles in India. It’s a dangerous, expensive and deeply unjust world we’re creating. And Trump’s is the loudest voice in the “nah, no biggie” camp. The second problem is that the math behind the trillion-trees idea has come under scrutiny. I’ll spare you the details, which were outlined in a smart article in Wired, but researchers in the journal Science have been going back and forth over how much carbon those trees actually will pull out of the atmosphere, how many of them actually can be planted (and where) what happens to people in those places, and how long it will take for those trees to vacuum up carbon. A 2019 estimate in Science of how much carbon the trees actually could absorb, which grabbed lots of public and scientific attention, “was much too high,” said Carla Staver, an associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Yale University. It gave the erroneous impression that trees could be the silver bullet needed to solve the climate crisis, she said. “I understand the appeal of this,” Staver told me. “It is a much less difficult solution to climate change if it were to indeed work… Where it becomes insidious and problematic is that we have good evidence that it won’t work, and that it’s a distraction from the things that will work, (such as) making difficult decisions to cut emissions.” Join us on Twitter and Facebook At best, it takes decades for the trees to be effective, said Foley, from Project Drawdown. That’s because trees grow slowly, amassing carbon in their structures as they grow. Trees should be part of the solution, Foley said. It’s bizarre – and hypocritical – to see this environmentalist pose coming from Trump. Planting trees is “100% necessary, because we know that we need to pull carbon out of the atmosphere, not just reduce our emissions,” said DeWitt, from the World Resources Institute. “It’s commendable if it’s done appropriately. And — it’s grossly insufficient on its own. It has to be paired with sound conservation. It has to be part of an overall menu (of climate solutions) that includes decarbonization of our energy systems and transportation systems.” Silver buckshot, not silver bullet. Yes, we need to mop pollution out of the atmosphere. But, first, the spill."

Real-world testing has now begun on Proton Technologies’ “Hygenic Earth Energy” (HEE) concept, and if all goes to plan, the technology could revolutionise the global energy industry, potentially killing off the nascent renewables-based green hydrogen industry and providing a method of harnessing huge amounts of “low-cost, high profit, zero emissions” energy from existing oil fields without any carbon emissions. Related ‘Germany will need to import hydrogen on a large scale' Related Green hydrogen demand in Europe a 100GW+ opportunity for renewables The concept is remarkably simple, even if it sounds dangerously insane. Air or oxygen is pumped into the underground oil or gas reservoir, or coal bed, and ignited to set fire to the hydrocarbons. When the fire reaches temperatures above 500°C, injected steam or existing water vapour reacts with the hydrocarbons to produce syngas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. Adding extra water to the syngas creates a reaction that produces CO2 and more hydrogen. But the carbon dioxide and other impurities would remain underground as patented palladium-alloy membranes allow only the hydrogen to diffuse through the metal lattice. The company says it will eventually produce this clean hydrogen for $0.10-0.50 per kilogram. This would be a massive cost reduction for the versatile clean-burning fuel. The cheapest hydrogen produced today — from steam methane reforming and coal gasification, which release nine to 12 tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere for every tonne of H2 produced — costs $1-1.80/kg, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). Green hydrogen — produced by powering electrolysers that split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen with renewable energy — costs $2.50-6.80 today, according to BloombergNEF. The analyst also says that economies of scale could bring down the cost of green H2 to as low as $1.40/kg by 2030 and $0.80/kg by 2050. A Flourish data visualization But if Proton can prove its technology, not only could it make green hydrogen uneconomic for decades to come, but the speed of production would probably far outpace the growth of renewable H2. The low cost of Proton’s hydrogen is partly due to the economies of scale — vast quantities of the gas could be extracted cheaply from each oil or gas reservoir or coal bed, and partly because it can take advantage of hydrocarbons that are otherwise uneconomic to extract — such as depleted or abandoned oil & gas reservoirs — which would therefore be cheap to buy. “In broad terms, about 70% of oil remains in the ground after production, because it is inaccessible or uneconomic to recover.

Thus, if HEE can yield clean energy — with virtually zero greenhouse-gas emissions — from heavy oil reserves, the impact is signiﬁcant on both the world economy and environment,” the company states. “The ideal target for HEE in heavy oil reservoirs would be reservoirs with greater than 40% water saturation. At present, these reservoirs are considered inaccessible. But for HEE, the high water saturation becomes an advantage.” The economics and the environmental implications [will] make people look very hard at whether they want to continue conventional oil production This month, Proton began real-world testing at the Superb oil field in Saskatchewan, a layer of sand 700 metres below the surface that contains 200 million barrels of heavy crude. For this initial study, Proton will test their palladium membranes at the surface and release the CO2 into the atmosphere, while at the next larger field test, the membranes would be used underground, as required to keep the CO2 below the surface. Nevertheless, Proton hopes to produce commercial amounts of hydrogen from the Superb field in the coming months. Proton chief executive Grant Strem claims that the Calgary-based company’s process could produce enough hydrogen from just the heavy-oil fields in the Canadian province of Alberta to “supply Canada's entire electricity requirements for 330 years”. “The economics and the environmental implications [will] make people look very hard at whether they want to continue conventional oil production,” he told a geochemical conference last year. But just how feasible is Proton’s plan? Jennifer Wilcox, a chemical engineer at the Massachusetts-based Worcester Polytechnic Institute, told Science magazine that the palladium membranes can be “fragile and finicky” even when used at the surface, adding: “When doing everything underground, it’s difficult to have control.” And Geoffrey Maitland, a chemical engineer at Imperial College London, added: “This chemistry is well-proven at the surface. The challenge is controlling these processes several kilometres underground.” The reason why the Proton technology could be so important is that clean hydrogen (produced without greenhouse-gas emissions) can play a vital role in decarbonizing the world’s energy system.

27,https://www.greenbiz.com/article/conserving-and-restoring-forests-wont-be-cheap-and-easy-after-all,f1y6he,Conserving and restoring forests won’t be cheap and easy after all | Trellis,"The corporate world has fallen for trees. But to be effective, the cost of offsetting CO2 emissions with the sequestration power of forests will have to go up. Are companies willing to pay?In Dr. Seuss’ “The Lorax,” the character who represents industry succumbs to a feverish greed and chops down every last tree in the forest surrounding Thneedville. In real life these days, the corporate world is all about planting them.From Microsoft to JetBlue to Royal Dutch Shell, an increasing number of companies are seeking to offset a portion of their greenhouse gas emission by investing in forest protection and reforestation. This new corporate enthusiasm for trees could create the boon advocates of programs such as the United Nations’ Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation initiative (REDD+) have longed for. However, if businesses really want to put a dent in Earth-warming emissions by protecting and planting trees, the future of carbon offsetting through forestry will have to look very different from the past.That’s a very big if, because perhaps the primary reason companies are drawn to trees as a climate solution is how simple and cheap the concept sounds. Trees! How could we not see you were the one? You were right in front of us the whole time! In reality, carbon offsetting through forest conservation and reforestation is far from simple and won’t be cheap — not if real, meaningful emissions reductions are the goal.To be effective, improvements will have to be made around the verification and monitoring of conservation projects, which have a long history of problems and have produced, at best, mixed results when it comes to reducing emissions. Complicated land-use issues — such as how to restore forests and increase food production by 50 percent by 2050 — also will need to be tackled; and the price of carbon offsets will have to go up. A lot.The question is: When push comes to shove, will companies be willing to do, and pay, what it takes to do the job right?“What we need to do, it’s not going to be as cheap as people think is,” said Timothy Searchinger, a Princeton researcher who studies land use and climate change. “If all you’re paying is $10 per ton [of CO2], you’re probably not doing it right.”The latest science says we need to cut 30 gigatons a year of carbon emissions by 2030 to keep global temperature rise within the realm of the Paris Agreement target of “well below 2 degrees Celsius.” Nature can provide roughly one-third of the reductions needed, through better management of agricultural and grazing lands and the protection and restoration of forests and wetlands, according to The Nature Conservancy.In other words, two-thirds still need to come by transitioning to a clean energy economy and investing in technical solutions to removing carbon. This is something everyone, even the proponents of carbon offsets, stresses: buying offsets or simply planting trees will not fix the climate crisis and should not be a substitute for cutting emissions.“We have to do all it. We need to protect forests, and we need to reduce energy emissions,” Searchinger said. “Offsetting should only be something that’s done when there really is no other option.”This makes how offsets fit into a company’s sustainability plan more important than the extent to which it uses them. Announcing that your organization is offsetting 30 percent of your business’ CO2 emissions with trees, while meeting 100 percent of its electricity and transportation needs by burning fossil fuels won’t help the planet or the company’s public relations.This is why efforts such as the One Trillion Trees initiative, created by Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, have come under such scrutiny despite everyone agreeing that planting trees is a good thing. More than 300 companies have signed onto the initiative, which Benioff talked up at The World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January.Fear of the greenwashing label hasn’t quelled corporate interest in forestry offsets.Volume on what’s known the voluntary carbon markets — where companies that are not government-mandated to reduce emissions (which is the vast majority) buy carbon credits — hit a seven-year high in 2018, jumping 52.6 percent from just two years earlier, according to a recent report from Ecosystems Marketplace.This broad-based corporate demand was driven mostly by companies entering the market for the first time, which the report noted was a change from previous years. It also was dominated by interest in nature-based solutions such as reforestation or regenerative agriculture, which soared by 264 percent, and continued to grow in 2019.Verra, a nonprofit that develops standards for carbon offsetting projects, reported in December that its issuance of voluntary carbon units for forestry and other land-use projects nearly doubled last year compared with 2018.“It took me by surprise what happened in the last 12 months, that all of a sudden there was so much demand for carbon credits. All of these corporates were reaching out to us,” said Charlotte Streck, founder of Climate Focus, an Amsterdam-based carbon market advisory that’s advising EasyJet. The British discount airline in November said it would make forest conservation and reforestation in South America and Africa a central part of its plan to be the first airline in the world to offset all of its carbon emissions.Normally, increased demand pushes prices up, however, on the voluntary market the average price for forestry and land use offsets stayed stuck at around $3 per ton of CO2 in 2018, the Ecosystems Marketplace report shows. This was because of a glut in supply that allowed companies to buy wholesale and negotiate lower prices.“Companies were buying up a lot of inventory that’s been verified and is just sitting around,” said Jeremy Manion, forestry carbon markets lead at the Arbor Day Foundation, which develops projects in the U.S. and 26 other countries.For example, following EasyJet’s announcement that it would spend roughly $32.5 million a year over three years supporting forestry, clean energy and community-based efficiency projects, The Financial Times reported this would work out to less than $4 per ton of CO2.That’s at the low end of the roughly $4 to $10 range that forestry offsets are selling for on the voluntary market, and nowhere near where experts say prices need to be to supplement incomes for landowners and create real, lasting emissions reductions.The Arbor Day Foundation partners with the GreenTrees restoration project in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley, which has supplied the vast majority of U.S. forestry credits registered on the voluntary market, according to the GreenTrees website. “We’ve been able to be successful to date by piecing together these diversified income streams in addition to the carbon credits,” Manion said, including revenues from sustainably harvested timber, fees for hunting, fishing and camping, and funds from the U.S. Department of Agriculture for wetland conservation.In the United States, a carbon price of $50 a ton would result in roughly 200 million tons of carbon sequestered annually through forest restoration, according to a U.S. Forestry Service report. At $100 per ton, an additional 100 million tons of carbon would be sequestered each year, the report says. In the Global South, a price of as low as $20 per ton dramatically could slow deforestation, especially in Africa, and suck up nearly six gigatons of carbon dioxide, according to another report, published last year in the scientific journal Nature Climate Change.It’s unclear what it would mean to, say, the cost of an airline ticket if demand on the voluntary market and pricing on the regulatory compliance markets — currently around $26 per ton on the European Union’s carbon trading system, and $17 on California’s cap-and-trade system — pushes prices on the voluntary market up at some point in the future.Both EasyJet and JetBlue, which in January became the first major U.S. airline to announce plans to go carbon-neutral on all domestic flights, say they are absorbing the cost. “We are baking the price of carbon into our business model going forward,” Sophia Mendelsohn, head of sustainability and environmental social governance at JetBlue, told GreenBiz.Perhaps these early adopters are betting that upcoming regulation will level out the playing field with competitors. Under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), most airlines will be required to buy offsets to account for any growth in CO2 emissions above 2020 levels.

The Silicon Valley giant has agreed to purchase offsets at $15 a ton.By CJ ClouseFebruary 10, 2020(Updated on July 24, 2024)11:00 AM (ET)DECARBONIZATION Conserving and restoring forests won’t be cheap and easy after all The corporate world has fallen for trees. But to be effective, the cost of offsetting CO2 emissions with the sequestration power of forests will have to go up. Are companies willing to pay? By CJ Clouse February 10, 2020 (Updated on July 24, 2024) In Dr. Seuss’ “The Lorax,” the character who represents industry succumbs to a feverish greed and chops down every last tree in the forest surrounding Thneedville. In real life these days, the corporate world is all about planting them. From Microsoft to JetBlue to Royal Dutch Shell, an increasing number of companies are seeking to offset a portion of their greenhouse gas emission by investing in forest protection and reforestation. This new corporate enthusiasm for trees could create the boon advocates of programs such as the United Nations’ Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation initiative (REDD+) have longed for. However, if businesses really want to put a dent in Earth-warming emissions by protecting and planting trees, the future of carbon offsetting through forestry will have to look very different from the past. That’s a very big if, because perhaps the primary reason companies are drawn to trees as a climate solution is how simple and cheap the concept sounds. Trees! How could we not see you were the one? You were right in front of us the whole time! In reality, carbon offsetting through forest conservation and reforestation is far from simple and won’t be cheap — not if real, meaningful emissions reductions are the goal. To be effective, improvements will have to be made around the verification and monitoring of conservation projects, which have a long history of problems and have produced, at best, mixed results when it comes to reducing emissions. Complicated land-use issues — such as how to restore forests and increase food production by 50 percent by 2050 — also will need to be tackled; and the price of carbon offsets will have to go up. A lot. The question is: When push comes to shove, will companies be willing to do, and pay, what it takes to do the job right? “What we need to do, it’s not going to be as cheap as people think is,” said Timothy Searchinger, a Princeton researcher who studies land use and climate change. “If all you’re paying is $10 per ton [of CO2], you’re probably not doing it right.” Planting trees is good, but… The latest science says we need to cut 30 gigatons a year of carbon emissions by 2030 to keep global temperature rise within the realm of the Paris Agreement target of “well below 2 degrees Celsius.” Nature can provide roughly one-third of the reductions needed, through better management of agricultural and grazing lands and the protection and restoration of forests and wetlands, according to The Nature Conservancy. In other words, two-thirds still need to come by transitioning to a clean energy economy and investing in technical solutions to removing carbon. This is something everyone, even the proponents of carbon offsets, stresses: buying offsets or simply planting trees will not fix the climate crisis and should not be a substitute for cutting emissions. “We have to do all it. We need to protect forests, and we need to reduce energy emissions,” Searchinger said. “Offsetting should only be something that’s done when there really is no other option.” This makes how offsets fit into a company’s sustainability plan more important than the extent to which it uses them. Announcing that your organization is offsetting 30 percent of your business’ CO2 emissions with trees, while meeting 100 percent of its electricity and transportation needs by burning fossil fuels won’t help the planet or the company’s public relations. This is why efforts such as the One Trillion Trees initiative, created by Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, have come under such scrutiny despite everyone agreeing that planting trees is a good thing. More than 300 companies have signed onto the initiative, which Benioff talked up at The World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January. Put your money where your CO2 is Fear of the greenwashing label hasn’t quelled corporate interest in forestry offsets. Volume on what’s known the voluntary carbon markets — where companies that are not government-mandated to reduce emissions (which is the vast majority) buy carbon credits — hit a seven-year high in 2018, jumping 52.6 percent from just two years earlier, according to a recent report from Ecosystems Marketplace. This broad-based corporate demand was driven mostly by companies entering the market for the first time, which the report noted was a change from previous years. It also was dominated by interest in nature-based solutions such as reforestation or regenerative agriculture, which soared by 264 percent, and continued to grow in 2019. Verra, a nonprofit that develops standards for carbon offsetting projects, reported in December that its issuance of voluntary carbon units for forestry and other land-use projects nearly doubled last year compared with 2018. “It took me by surprise what happened in the last 12 months, that all of a sudden there was so much demand for carbon credits. All of these corporates were reaching out to us,” said Charlotte Streck, founder of Climate Focus, an Amsterdam-based carbon market advisory that’s advising EasyJet. The British discount airline in November said it would make forest conservation and reforestation in South America and Africa a central part of its plan to be the first airline in the world to offset all of its carbon emissions. Normally, increased demand pushes prices up, however, on the voluntary market the average price for forestry and land use offsets stayed stuck at around $3 per ton of CO2 in 2018, the Ecosystems Marketplace report shows. This was because of a glut in supply that allowed companies to buy wholesale and negotiate lower prices. “Companies were buying up a lot of inventory that’s been verified and is just sitting around,” said Jeremy Manion, forestry carbon markets lead at the Arbor Day Foundation, which develops projects in the U.S. and 26 other countries. For example, following EasyJet’s announcement that it would spend roughly $32.5 million a year over three years supporting forestry, clean energy and community-based efficiency projects, The Financial Times reported this would work out to less than $4 per ton of CO2. That’s at the low end of the roughly $4 to $10 range that forestry offsets are selling for on the voluntary market, and nowhere near where experts say prices need to be to supplement incomes for landowners and create real, lasting emissions reductions. The Arbor Day Foundation partners with the GreenTrees restoration project in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley, which has supplied the vast majority of U.S. forestry credits registered on the voluntary market, according to the GreenTrees website. “We’ve been able to be successful to date by piecing together these diversified income streams in addition to the carbon credits,” Manion said, including revenues from sustainably harvested timber, fees for hunting, fishing and camping, and funds from the U.S. Department of Agriculture for wetland conservation. In the United States, a carbon price of $50 a ton would result in roughly 200 million tons of carbon sequestered annually through forest restoration, according to a U.S. Forestry Service report. At $100 per ton, an additional 100 million tons of carbon would be sequestered each year, the report says. In the Global South, a price of as low as $20 per ton dramatically could slow deforestation, especially in Africa, and suck up nearly six gigatons of carbon dioxide, according to another report, published last year in the scientific journal Nature Climate Change. From surplus to shortfall It’s unclear what it would mean to, say, the cost of an airline ticket if demand on the voluntary market and pricing on the regulatory compliance markets — currently around $26 per ton on the European Union’s carbon trading system, and $17 on California’s cap-and-trade system — pushes prices on the voluntary market up at some point in the future. Both EasyJet and JetBlue, which in January became the first major U.S. airline to announce plans to go carbon-neutral on all domestic flights, say they are absorbing the cost. “We are baking the price of carbon into our business model going forward,” Sophia Mendelsohn, head of sustainability and environmental social governance at JetBlue, told GreenBiz. Perhaps these early adopters are betting that upcoming regulation will level out the playing field with competitors. Under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), most airlines will be required to buy offsets to account for any growth in CO2 emissions above 2020 levels. CORSIA begins a voluntary pilot phase next year and a second mandatory phase in 2027. With the excess supply selling off, prices on the voluntary carbon market will no doubt rise as companies vie for quality projects. “We’re coming up on a shortage of supply for reforestation carbon credits,” Manion said. “For the GreenTrees project, we’re selling out. We’ll probably be sold out before the next verification in the spring.” As project developers attempt to meet quickly rising demand, it becomes all the more important that projects, particularly REDD+ and other conservation projects, meet strong verification criteria and are diligently monitored. To result in a true emissions reduction, the protected area needs to stay protected indefinitely. And if deforestation was planned in one area to make way for, say, a cattle ranch, the result of conserving that land can’t be that the rancher simply shifts over to another piece of land and cuts the trees down there instead. The most difficult issue to solve with forest conservation projects, though, is determining whether the trees were even going to be cut down in the first place. “A lot of what gets protected wouldn’t have been cut down anyway,” said Paul Ferraro, a professor at Johns Hopkins University, who studies the environmental and social impacts of public and private programs. “Say there’s a plot of valuable agricultural land that’s going to be cut down, but protecting that area is politically impossible. What happens is they protect this other area that’s away from the roads, away from the cities, with very few resources to exploit it.” Ferraro says this is called the “high and far” phenomenon. Tech to the rescue? Apropos of the world we’re living in, there is at least one tech startup that believes it can solve these problems. Pachama uses machine learning on a combination of satellite, drone and lidar images to calculate a project’s potential for sequestering CO2 and keep tabs on it over time.

Related Rise of renewables 'no silver bullet' in solving climate change: report The global energy organisation said the flatlining came against expectations and “was primarily due to declining emissions from electricity generation in advanced economies, thanks to the expanding role of renewable sources (mainly wind and solar), fuel switching from coal to natural gas, and higher nuclear power generation”. Continued growth in emissions despite massive investments in renewables over the last 10 years was a major cause of concern over progress of the energy transition.

[Brown University] — Major oil corporations tend to spend the most money on advertising and promotional campaigns at moments when they face negative media coverage and/or the threat of increased federal regulation, a new study finds.Robert Brulle, a Brown University visiting professor based at the Institute at Brown for Environment and Society, led an analysis concluding that investments in advertising and promotion by major oil companies directly correspond to Congressional action and media coverage on climate change.The findings, published on Saturday, Dec. 14 in Climatic Change, suggest that oil company executives target their promotional efforts in ways designed to influence policymakers and to shape the public climate-change debate.“All corporations rely on advertising to burnish their brands and minimize damage to their reputation,” Brulle said. “But this analysis, combined with previous research, demonstrates that ad campaigns in the oil and gas sector are specifically intended to influence how the public and lawmakers think about the climate crisis and whether they act to address it. It shows that the rise and fall of spending levels is directly related to whether or not climate legislation is being considered.”Working with Melissa Aronczyk of Rutgers University and Jason Carmichael of McGill University, Brulle analyzed the annual corporate promotion advertising space purchases of ExxonMobil, BP-Amoco, Chevron-Texaco, Royal Dutch Shell and ConocoPhillips between 1986 and 2015. The researchers focused on four major factors that prior scholarship suggests might influence these companies’ promotional expenditures: Congressional attention to climate change, corporate reputation, media attention on climate change, and public concern about climate change.To gauge the extent to which each factor affects advertising spending, the researchers collected data on hearings, bills, treaties and other climate change-related legislation; consulted Fortune’s annual Corporate Reputation Index; measured levels of climate change-related media coverage; and tracked the timing of major oil spills and the release of major reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.Brulle said the team found that two of the four factors motivated the majority of oil companies’ advertising spending: climate change-related media coverage and Congressional action.“It seems their objective in advertising is to deflect criticism and avoid legislative action that attempts to address climate change,” Brulle said. “That suggests that their primary motivation is to avoid the potential of additional regulatory scrutiny.”The findings also suggest, Brulle said, that oil executives are less concerned with public mood on climate change and with the release of major climate change reports, which invariably portray their companies in a negative light.

After noting more work needed to be done, he expressed hope that “we all remember 2019 as a definitive peak in global emissions.""Climate analysts are less sanguine. IEA’s findings supported a trend found in other recent reports: that a sharp drop in coal generation was responsible for lower emissions in the United States and Europe—and that everywhere else the picture looked bleak.Coal consumption continues to increase in China and India. Emissions from transportation, industry and other major sectors of the economy show little signs of decline. Some analysts even questioned whether IEA was overly optimistic about the United States, where it projected a deeper decline than America’s own energy forecaster, the Energy Information Administration.The relationship between economic growth and emissions long has been a focus of climate efforts. Generally, when the world’s economy heats up, so does the amount of carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere. The three years between 2014 and 2016 were an exception, when energy efficiency measures and renewables growth offset emissions from increased economic activity.There is reason to think 2019’s emissions pause will be similarly fleeting, analysts said.Developing economies, led by China and India, continue to add coal plants at a rapid clip. China is building 99.7 gigawatts of coal capacity while India has 36.7 GW of new coal under construction, according to the Global Energy Monitor, a watchdog group.

Monsoons in India, for instance, produced an increase in hydropower generation at the expense of coal. And while the global economy grew in 2019, it did so at a slower rate than 2018.“We are seeing weakening of coal growth and strength in renewables, which is good news. We also see persistent growth in oil and gas, which is bad news,” said Glen Peters, research director at the Centre for International Climate and Environmental Research in Oslo, Norway. “How the declines in coal and growth in oil and gas balance out will dictate if we get a peak in emissions, but my expectation is that emissions will remain between flat and slightly up for the next few years.”Others wondered about the discrepancy between the IEA and EIA findings. Where IEA forecast a 2.9% decrease in American emissions last year, EIA predicted a 2.1% decline.The difference is potentially significant. The Rhodium Group, an independent research firm, estimates the United States would need to average annual emissions reductions of 2.8% to 3.2% to have a shot at meeting the Paris climate accords’ emissions target: a 26%-28% reduction from 2005 levels by 2025. The United States has averaged annual emissions reductions of 0.9% since 2005.The reason for the discrepancy was not immediately clear. The IEA analysis was preliminary, and the agency did not provide the underlying data for its analysis. It also did not respond to a request for comment. The agency is expected to release a more comprehensive analysis next month.“Because the U.S. share of emissions is so large, it has a big difference on global trends,” said Rachel Cleetus, policy director for the Union of Concerned Scientists’ climate and energy program. “Big picture, I have some questions about the underlying data.”The caveats don’t end there. IEA only considers carbon emissions from energy sources. It does not account for wildfires, for example—such as those that tore through the Amazon and Australia last year. The agency also does not measure methane emissions associated with natural gas use, which has dislodged coal from electricity markets in the United States and Europe.Methane is a less potent greenhouse gas than CO2 when burned, but it is much more powerful when leaked from wellheads, pipelines and other oil field equipment.“We’re taking a little bit more credit than we deserve when we swap coal for natural gas,” said Rob Jackson, a Stanford University professor.Jackson was a contributor to a 2019 Global Carbon Project report that projected global emissions would grow by 0.6% last year. To date, success in taming global emissions has been limited to power plants.“When do we start to bend the curve beyond coal to include transportation, in particular, but even natural gas?” Jackson asked. “We’re building natural gas plants around the world at breakneck pace, and we can’t continue to do that.”Analysts were quick to point to good news for climate in IEA’s findings. The agency reported coal generation in the United States and Europe fell by 15% and 25%, respectively, helping to drive emissions lower in both regions.Japan, a country that recently has moved to replace much of its nuclear fleet with coal in the wake of the Fukushima Daiichi disaster, also recorded a notable decline, IEA said. Emissions there were down 4.3% in 2019, IEA said, as nuclear output rose to displace coal, gas and oil generation.Those decreases helped offset emissions growth in other parts of the world, where CO2 emissions increased by 400 million tons.Gernot Wagner, an economist at New York University, said coal’s diverging fortunes highlight a growing emissions challenge.Emissions have migrated with global supply chains. As manufacturing and industry shift from advanced economies to developing ones, CO2 output has increased in countries like China while emissions in America and Europe have declined.Yet the two remain linked, he said.“Production-based emissions in developed countries are beginning to look good for a lot of reasons,” Wagner said. But it is also right that “Apple doesn’t produce iPhones in California and Volvo doesn’t produce cars in Sweden.”He added: “Where does the buck stop? In many ways, the buck stops with the consumer.”And that points to the big picture. Carbon emissions are global in scope. Emissions declines in some regions are welcome signs of progress. But CO2 emissions across the whole world need to reach net zero to reduce carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere to sustainable levels.“The slowdown is good news, but there is little in sight to tell us we are about to reduce emissions at the rates necessary for 1.5 [degrees Celsius] or 2 C,” said Peters, the Centre for International Climate and Environmental Research analyst. Scientists say that for the world to avoid the worst effects of climate change, it has to limit temperature increases to 1.5 or 2 C.By Peters’ estimation, the world is headed toward a global temperature rise of 3 C.Reprinted from Climatewire with permission from E&E News.

NASA EarthFatih Birol saw it as “welcome news.” Global carbon dioxide emissions last year remained flat, stuck at 33 gigatons, even as the world economy grew 2.9%. “Despite widespread expectations of yet another increase, our analysis shows that in fact CO2 emissions, carbon emissions last year, stopped growing,” Birol, the head of the International Energy Agency, said in a video posted to Twitter. After noting more work needed to be done, he expressed hope that “we all remember 2019 as a definitive peak in global emissions."" Climate analysts are less sanguine. IEA’s findings supported a trend found in other recent reports: that a sharp drop in coal generation was responsible for lower emissions in the United States and Europe—and that everywhere else the picture looked bleak. Coal consumption continues to increase in China and India. Emissions from transportation, industry and other major sectors of the economy show little signs of decline. Some analysts even questioned whether IEA was overly optimistic about the United States, where it projected a deeper decline than America’s own energy forecaster, the Energy Information Administration. The relationship between economic growth and emissions long has been a focus of climate efforts. Generally, when the world’s economy heats up, so does the amount of carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere. The three years between 2014 and 2016 were an exception, when energy efficiency measures and renewables growth offset emissions from increased economic activity. There is reason to think 2019’s emissions pause will be similarly fleeting, analysts said. Developing economies, led by China and India, continue to add coal plants at a rapid clip.

37,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200217-can-rationing-carbon-help-fight-climate-change,f62dh7,Can rationing carbon help fight climate change?,"Experiments in setting individuals a carbon allowance have been trialled from Finland to Australia, and some have proved popular. But can carbon rationing ever be fair?Once a day, Katja Suhonen opens her phone to check on her carbon footprint. Every journey she makes in her home city of Lahti, a city in the south of Finland, is studied by an experimental app called CitiCap and the carbon impact of her travel choices deducted from a weekly budget.“I have mainly travelled around by bike, public transport and walking before even using CitiCap, so it hasn’t really changed my daily routine,” says Suhonen, an early adopter of the voluntary monitoring scheme. “However, now I try to avoid private car even more than before.” If she has any credits left by the end of the week, she can exchange them for gifts like coffee or a free bike tune-up in participating businesses. Her journeys are automatically tracked by the app, and she only needs to manually input details such as how many passengers she is with if she is travelling by car.The CitiCap app is funded by the EU’s Urban Innovative Actions, which supports projects that test out “new and unproven solutions” to issues faced by cities. In Lahti, that means cutting the impact of residents’ travel around the city. While Finland has plans to be carbon neutral by 2035, Lahti aims to get there a decade earlier. The city has already halved its carbon emissions since 1990 but to get to net zero will take a lot more work. Transport is set to be a key part of that.You might also like:Suhonen is something of an outlier in Lahti: just 5% of journeys in the town are made by bus, with most people opting to travel by car, says Anna Huttunen, who works in the city’s sustainable mobility team and is project manager of CitiCap.Huttunen launched the app in late 2019 in an effort to get more people using public transport. She says the goal of the project is not only to reduce carbon emissions from travel, but also to learn what the city is lacking in terms of sustainable transport and how best to provide it. Huttunen says that by 2030, she hopes that half of all journeys in the city will be made using lower carbon choices such as cycling or public transport.This isn’t the first time politicians have dabbled in the idea of personal carbon allowances. The British politician David Miliband raised the idea in 2006, while he was the UK’s environment secretary, citing the contribution citizens could make to tackling climate change. But a subsequent investigation by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) reported that a scheme to track everyone’s carbon use was too costly, unproven and lacked public support. Defra concluded that carbon rationing was “an idea currently ahead of its time”. With that, personal carbon allowances vanished from UK political discourse.“It’s an idea that got high level political attention too early, and there wasn’t a research base,” says Tina Fawcett, a senior researcher at the University of Oxford’s Environmental Change Institute. “In theory it’s a great idea. In practice, it’s quite complicated. You really need research into the nitty gritty.”Carbon creditsAlthough it didn’t become policy in the UK, the idea did capture the imagination of individuals. Carbon reduction action groups, or CRAGs, sprung up across the country as people took matters into their own hands. Among them was Angela Raffle, a medical doctor from Bristol.“When my neighbour first said ‘Is there more we can be doing in our own lives about climate change?’, my immediate response subconsciously was ‘There’s nothing I can do, the government is in charge of this’,” she says. “Since then I’ve gradually become completely engaged in positive action. It was a very powerful question.”Raffle downloaded a CRAG spreadsheet and began tracking her carbon footprint. Once every three months she met with other members of the group to share results and discuss strategies for cutting their emissions. The plan only recorded emissions from travel and home energy use, but the group soon found themselves thinking about the impact of other areas of their lives, such as shopping choices, food consumption, and white goods. “We reduced our household footprint to a third or a quarter of what it had been,” she says. “Just by thinking and being aware of it.”On the other side of world, researchers at Australia’s Southern Cross University were planning their own experiment on Norfolk Island, a tiny Australian territory 1,500 kilometres from the mainland. With only one natural gas supplier, one power company, and a handful of petrol stations, it was the perfect self-contained place to study people’s fossil fuel use. In 2013, a quarter of the island’s 800 households were recruited to a carbon reduction scheme.Alex Hendry wrote the software that helped calculate the islanders’ carbon footprint. “Much like a frequent flyer scheme, users had a card with an ID number, and when they purchased petrol or diesel from a service station they swiped the card,” he says. This data was compiled with home energy use and shared with residents every three months.The goal was to empower people to reduce their carbon footprint by giving them a better understanding of it. “Even people who are trying to actively reduce their carbon footprint have very little idea of what their footprint is and where it comes from,” says Hendry. “Is it electricity, is it petrol? Am I better off not driving, or making sure all my lights are off at home?” When the experiment ended 16 months later, almost two-thirds of the residents said they wanted it to continue.Back in the UK, Adam Hardy, campaign director of CarbonRationing.org, is trying to take this idea to the next level. Where the Lahti experiment focuses only on incentivising lower emissions, Hardy wants to see disincentives for individuals who over-emit. He envisions a nationwide “total carbon rationing” programme that goes all the way back to the energy supplier, to give a figure for the carbon emissions in the atmosphere as a result of any given product. This would require auditing the carbon footprint of the supply chain of everything sold in the UK, including imports.“People are doing what they can on a personal level to reduce their carbon footprint, and hopefully getting everyone to follow suit,” he says. “Unfortunately, it’s not going to happen fast enough, laudable as it is.” For carbon rationing to work, everyone – especially the high emitters – have to be enrolled.With customers only given a limited number of carbon rations to spend each week, everyone from supermarkets to saunas would be incentivised to reduce the carbon footprint of their offering, thereby making it more attractive to consumers. But, crucially, those who wanted to maintain high-impact lifestyles, such as regularly flying around the world, would have to buy extra carbon credits from someone else. “What you’re looking at is effectively making carbon into a second currency,” he says.A dark cloudSome would see this as a draconian – even totalitarian – policy. Yet Hardy says it offers a greater degree of freedom than carbon taxes. “Carbon rationing offers you a lifestyle choice. You don’t have to go green on everything, you can choose”. The alternative, he says, is “an almost despairing attempt to get the world to become low carbon through moral example.”Policymakers may be forgiven for thinking that carbon rationing is political suicide. A 2012 survey by the Carbon Trust found that while people supported carbon rationing in principle, the mood soured when it came to actually making compromises on things like foreign holidays and their shopping basket. “I love my cheese and I will always buy it, even if you tell me it’s bad for my carbon footprint,” said one respondent. “It makes me happy.”And despite being billed by Hardy as more equitable than a flat carbon tax, carbon rationing could still hit poorer households harder. “People in the low-income groups may have an above-average energy use, because they live in inefficient homes,” says the University of Oxford’s Tina Fawcett. Rural populations are also likely to be penalised, as there are fewer options for getting around besides cars.In Lahti, every CitiCap user is given a personalised carbon allowance that accounts for some of these factors, such as how close they live to schools and their place of work. But the ethics of what constitutes a justifiable reason to burn more carbon is fraught with sensitivities. Should elderly people be penalised for living alone? Should parents be chastened for driving children to school during sub-zero weather, rather than walking?Despite organising her own carbon reduction group, Raffle is deeply sceptical of calls for a government-led plan. “We’ve designed a world so more fossil fuel energy could be sold,” she says. “We have people spending their entire lives advertising and promoting carbon-intensive ways of eating, living, travelling. Now we’re supposed to build this huge trading scheme to force people to ignore this.”Faced with an entrenched culture of consumerism, few research trials, wavering support from the public and a lack of political will, can a personal carbon allowance ever be more than an idea ahead of its time?People powerWell, yes. Because it turns out that you don’t need a compulsory nationwide carbon rationing system to achieve big reductions in emissions. Even very small, imperfect carbon allowance schemes have surprisingly powerful results.In the Norfolk Island study, participants were set a goal of reducing their fossil fuel use by 10% over the course of the study. No rewards were offered for doing so, nor were there any penalties for failing. And yet, the average household reduced their carbon footprint by 18%.Grassroots carbon reduction efforts also sidestep the prickly issue of policing lifestyle choices. Rather than punishing people for owning a car or living in the countryside, individuals are free to find as much or as little space in their own lives where they can economise.And while the Carbon Trust report found people resistant to change their core lifestyle, it also found they would embrace low carbon options where these existed, and widely supported labelling products with their carbon footprint to make that possible. The key was being given a choice, rather than an ultimatum. “It’s absolutely not about punishment or denials,” says Raffle. “By becoming more involved in this kind of stuff, in particular with other people, it actually becomes a positive part of your life.”Where political leadership has failed, community spirit appears to be stepping in. “I saw someone on Twitter the other day, saying that they were going to lead a one-tonne carbon lifestyle this year,” says Fawcett. “People are trying to communicate around the idea of voluntary restraint.” Politicians may shy away from talking about carbon allowances, but the dozens of smartphone apps available to track and reduce your carbon footprint shows the idea remains popular.And while it falls far short of total carbon rationing, Hardy says that labelling products with their carbon footprint is an important first step. “The politicians and policy makers don’t really believe in this stuff, they’re only going to take the idea seriously if it has some kind of threshold of followers,” he says, adding that his goal is to “put this dream out there… that it might all actually work.”Back in Lahti, Anna Huttunen admits that CitiCap is a partial solution at best. “The hard fact is that every city, Lahti especially, has a group of car drivers who won’t change their behaviour,” she says. “But a big group of people are ready to change. You need to start somewhere.”--The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2: the writer interviewed sources remotely.

38,https://www.southpole.com/blog/why-airlines-need-carbon-credits,f63jge,Why Airlines Need Carbon Credits,"I'm very excited by recent announcements by JetBlue and Delta Air Lines. Both have committed to ambitious climate goals. JetBlue will soon move forward on domestic flights and Delta will follow with all their flights on March 1 – with no less than a billion dollar investment over 10 years. In Europe, EasyJet flights have been carbon compensated since last November and BA and Air France have made compensation part of domestic flights since January. With Delta CEO Ed Bastian saying that we are in ""a race for our planet"", we are reminded that climate action is no longer a fringe idea in the airline industry.Airlines are major contributors to global greenhouse gas emissions. Barring a technological shift to electric planes, airlines will continue to burn jet fuel for the foreseeable future, making up something on the order of 2.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions.Improved operational efficiencies and the introduction of advanced biofuels will reduce emissions, but at the end of the day, carbon credits will continue to be needed to mitigate their overall effect on our global climate.One credit is the proof that one ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) has been avoided or removed by a climate-action project. These are projects like renewable energy, energy efficiency, waste treatment, climate-smart agriculture or planting trees.Airlines work regularly toward greater operational efficiency – not just in the name of protecting the climate, but because this yields immediate cost savings.Going the extra mile towards financing global emission reductions via credits has additional competitive advantages. Carbon offsets come into play quite simply because it's very difficult for an airline to reach net zero emissions today with operational changes or advances in sustainable aviation fuel. If an organisation wants to take climate action today, then investing in climate protection projects through certified carbon credits is the most viable solution.Aside from the moral argument, the reasoning behind going above and beyond ongoing decarbonization efforts is multifaceted:First, customers and the general public are increasingly asking for it. Employees too have a strong interest in working for companies that they feel are taking a positive, proactive stance on environmental matters. Just last month, Brian Kropp, Distinguished Vice President for Gartner, wrote that ""climate activism will be the next chapter for employee activism"".Second, big investors like Black Rock have made it very clear they expect action on sustainability and climate change to become important factors in their investment choices. Simply put, any long-term investment decision needs to consider the effects of climate change and whether a company is positioning itself in a way that will not hurt them or the economy at large.Finally, tougher industry regulation, driven by the interests of all of the above, is increasingly inevitable – and in the eyes of many, desired. Taking action now to improve efficiency, invest in sustainable aviation fuels and mitigate the wider carbon footprint is a hedge against future regulation. In fact regulation is already happening.For example, under CORSIA – an international agreement adopted by ICAO – airlines are required to compensate for emissions growth from international flights from 2020 onwards. Carbon credits are the main means for complying with CORSIA. Hence, fast movers will find themselves getting better prices for their carbon credits while their competitors loiter. Carbon offsetting is a market after all, and prices will only increase with demand.A carbon offset is a reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide – or another greenhouse gas – made in order to compensate for emissions made elsewhere. Offsets are measured in the equivalent of metric tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2e). Offsetting is a tool to accelerate emission reductions where they are possible. From a corporate perspective, it also puts a price on carbon, so now corporate emissions and the damage they cause has a price.Carbon credits are generated from projects around the world that can verify that they have reduced emissions, according to robust carbon standards and methodologies. By purchasing an offset credit, you are partly funding the investment. Offsetting funds existing projects, which encourages them to continue reducing emissions, while spurring the development of additional projects that lower emissions. Such climate action can also bring additional sustainable development benefits to the communities, such as cleaner water, air and better health, contributing to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.One such beneficiary is Mofal Mutenda, a farmer from the Kariba forest protection project. Zimbabwe lost almost a third of its forests between 1990 and 2010, and the project's goal is to help communities restore some of the dense forest and unique landscapes that historically covered Zimbabwe. Today, the project benefits more than 85,000 people and gives animals like elephants, lions and hippos a safe haven in the 785,000 hectare biodiversity corridor – that's equivalent to over a million football pitches! It's one of the largest registered REDD+ projects in the world.Running it all is possible thanks to our partners, such as VistaJet, who support and reward such projects by purchasing certified carbon credits, or offsets – in addition to working to reduce their own corporate emissions.That's not really the right question. Carbon is carbon. Provided that offsets are third-party verified to prove they are real, permanent, verifiable, additional and enforceable, it represents exactly what it says it does: one ton of CO 2e removed or avoided from being emitted into the atmosphere.At South Pole, we recommend that a company start its climate journey by first measuring what it emits and then taking steps to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, improve efficiency, and look closely at its overall impact on the ecosystem, including the entire supply chain.However, time is of the essence and what matters right now is how we can bend the arc of emissions globally. With that in mind, a ton of carbon reduced anywhere is a step in the right direction.“Want to learn more?

But what are carbon credits? One credit is the proof that one ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) has been avoided or removed by a climate-action project. These are projects like renewable energy, energy efficiency, waste treatment, climate-smart agriculture or planting trees. Airlines work regularly toward greater operational efficiency – not just in the name of protecting the climate, but because this yields immediate cost savings. Going the extra mile towards financing global emission reductions via credits has additional competitive advantages. Carbon offsets come into play quite simply because it's very difficult for an airline to reach net zero emissions today with operational changes or advances in sustainable aviation fuel. If an organisation wants to take climate action today, then investing in climate protection projects through certified carbon credits is the most viable solution. Aside from the moral argument, the reasoning behind going above and beyond ongoing decarbonization efforts is multifaceted: First, customers and the general public are increasingly asking for it. Employees too have a strong interest in working for companies that they feel are taking a positive, proactive stance on environmental matters. Just last month, Brian Kropp, Distinguished Vice President for Gartner, wrote that ""climate activism will be the next chapter for employee activism"". Second, big investors like Black Rock have made it very clear they expect action on sustainability and climate change to become important factors in their investment choices. Simply put, any long-term investment decision needs to consider the effects of climate change and whether a company is positioning itself in a way that will not hurt them or the economy at large. Finally, tougher industry regulation, driven by the interests of all of the above, is increasingly inevitable – and in the eyes of many, desired. Taking action now to improve efficiency, invest in sustainable aviation fuels and mitigate the wider carbon footprint is a hedge against future regulation. In fact regulation is already happening. For example, under CORSIA – an international agreement adopted by ICAO – airlines are required to compensate for emissions growth from international flights from 2020 onwards. Carbon credits are the main means for complying with CORSIA. Hence, fast movers will find themselves getting better prices for their carbon credits while their competitors loiter. Carbon offsetting is a market after all, and prices will only increase with demand. How do offsets work? A carbon offset is a reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide – or another greenhouse gas – made in order to compensate for emissions made elsewhere. Offsets are measured in the equivalent of metric tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2e). Offsetting is a tool to accelerate emission reductions where they are possible. From a corporate perspective, it also puts a price on carbon, so now corporate emissions and the damage they cause has a price. Carbon credits are generated from projects around the world that can verify that they have reduced emissions, according to robust carbon standards and methodologies. By purchasing an offset credit, you are partly funding the investment. Offsetting funds existing projects, which encourages them to continue reducing emissions, while spurring the development of additional projects that lower emissions. Such climate action can also bring additional sustainable development benefits to the communities, such as cleaner water, air and better health, contributing to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. One such beneficiary is Mofal Mutenda, a farmer from the Kariba forest protection project. Zimbabwe lost almost a third of its forests between 1990 and 2010, and the project's goal is to help communities restore some of the dense forest and unique landscapes that historically covered Zimbabwe. Today, the project benefits more than 85,000 people and gives animals like elephants, lions and hippos a safe haven in the 785,000 hectare biodiversity corridor – that's equivalent to over a million football pitches! It's one of the largest registered REDD+ projects in the world. Running it all is possible thanks to our partners, such as VistaJet, who support and reward such projects by purchasing certified carbon credits, or offsets – in addition to working to reduce their own corporate emissions. So, are carbon offsets perfect? That's not really the right question. Carbon is carbon. Provided that offsets are third-party verified to prove they are real, permanent, verifiable, additional and enforceable, it represents exactly what it says it does: one ton of CO 2e removed or avoided from being emitted into the atmosphere. At South Pole, we recommend that a company start its climate journey by first measuring what it emits and then taking steps to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, improve efficiency, and look closely at its overall impact on the ecosystem, including the entire supply chain. However, time is of the essence and what matters right now is how we can bend the arc of emissions globally. With that in mind, a ton of carbon reduced anywhere is a step in the right direction.

The magnitude of the glow is an excellent indicator of the amount of photosynthesis, or gross productivity, of plants in a given region.Research in 2013 led by Joanna Joiner, of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., demonstrated that fluorescence from plants could be teased out of data from existing satellites, which were designed and built for other purposes. The new research led by Luis Guanter of the Freie Universität Berlin, used the data for the first time to estimate photosynthesis from agriculture. Results were published March 25 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.According to co-author Christian Frankenberg of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., “The paper shows that fluorescence is a much better proxy for agricultural productivity than anything we’ve had before. This can go a long way regarding monitoring – and maybe even predicting – regional crop yields.”Guanter, Joiner and Frankenberg launched their collaboration at a 2012 workshop, hosted by the Keck Institute for Space Studies at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, to explore measurements of photosynthesis from space. The team noticed that on an annual basis, the tropics are the most productive. But during the Northern Hemisphere’s growing season, the U.S. Corn Belt “really stands out,” Frankenberg said. “Areas all over the world are not as productive as this area.”The researchers set out to describe the phenomenon observed by carefully interpreting the data from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment 2 (GOME-2) on Metop-A, a European meteorological satellite. Data showed that fluorescence from the Corn Belt, which extends from Ohio to Nebraska and Kansas, peaks in July at levels 40 percent greater than those observed in the Amazon.Comparison with ground-based measurements from carbon flux towers and yield statistics confirmed the results.The match between ground-based measurements and satellite measurements was a “pleasant surprise,” said Joiner, a co-author on the paper. Ground-based measurements have a resolution of about 0.4 square miles (1 square kilometer), while the satellite measurements currently have a resolution of more than 1,158 square miles (3,000 square kilometers). The study confirms that even with coarse resolution, the satellite method could estimate the photosynthetic activity occurring inside plants at the molecular level for areas with relatively homogenous vegetation like the Corn Belt.Challenges remain in estimating the productivity of fragmented agricultural areas, not properly sampled by current space-borne instruments. That’s where missions with better resolution could help, such as NASA’s Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 – a mission planned for launch in July 2014 that will also measure solar-induced fluorescence.The research could also help scientists improve the computer models that simulate Earth’s carbon cycle, as Guanter found a strong underestimation of crop photosynthesis in models. The analysis revealed that carbon cycle models – which scientists use to understand how carbon cycles through the ocean, land and atmosphere over time – underestimate the productivity of the Corn Belt by 40 to 60 percent.Unlike most vegetation, food crops are managed to maximize productivity. They usually have access to abundant nutrients and are irrigated. The Corn Belt, for example, receives water from the Mississippi River. Accounting for irrigation is currently a challenge for models, which is one reason why they underestimate agricultural productivity.“If we don’t take into account irrigation and other human influences in the agricultural areas, we’re not going to correctly estimate the amount of carbon taken up by vegetation, particularly corn,” Joiner said. “Corn plants are very productive in terms of assimilating carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This needs to be accounted for going forward in trying to predict how much of the atmospheric carbon dioxide will be taken up by crops in a changing climate.”According to Frankenberg, the remote sensing-based techniques now available could be a powerful monitoring tool for food security, especially data from OCO-2 and in combination with data from other upcoming satellites, such as NASA’s Soil Moisture Active Passive, scheduled for launch later this year.NASA monitors Earth’s vital signs from land, air and space with a fleet of satellites and ambitious airborne and ground-based observation campaigns.

Diamonds, trees, bogs and our bodies are chock full of carbon. Tiny factories in leaves called chloroplasts use sunlight for the energy needed to capture carbon from the carbon dioxide in the air. Carbon gets incorporated into tree trunks, leaves and twigs; this means as you look around a forest you see solid objects made of concentrated air.Animals cannot make their own carbon like plants can – they depend on eating plants, or on eating other animals that eat plants, to get carbon. Nature is expert at recycling carbon; capturing, decomposing and recapturing carbon is the normal cycle.Have you ever thought about where your body fat goes when you lose weight? The carbon part is breathed out as carbon dioxide, solid fat becoming air. Some of the carbon captured by plants and animals cycles between solid and gas forms quite quickly; other carbon stays in the body of the plant or animal for longer and can actually draw carbon down from the atmosphere and lock it away for hundreds, thousands or millions of years.Diamonds are the ultimate in long-term carbon. They formed deep in the Earth’s mantle from carbon trapped there during the planet’s formation long before carbon from land plants and animals started to build up. The carbon stored in fossil fuels is relatively recent compared to the carbon in diamonds.The build-up of dead plant and animal sediments at the bottom of oceans or lakes without oxygen meant few bacteria or fungi could decompose the dead organisms and free the carbon back into the atmosphere. Over geological timescales of millions of years, layers of undecayed materials were put under immense pressures and temperatures turning into compressed, hard, and valuable deposits of coal, oil and natural gas.The carbon in coal, oil and gas can be easily freed into the atmosphere by burning them. Millions of years of stored carbon has been pumped back into the atmosphere over the past few decades.Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and its rising level in the atmosphere is responsible for human-induced climate change. Slowing down and stopping the fossil fuel carbon emissions is essential to combat climate change but we also need ways to capture carbon from the atmosphere and make it still, solid and inert for long periods of time.Carbon can be pulled out of the atmosphere and stored for long periods of time in soils, bogs, ocean sediments and forests. Trees capture carbon and store it as wood. New forests pull carbon down from the atmosphere as they grow and even when trees are harvested they can provide medium-to-long-term carbon storage through the use of timber in long lived building materials or furniture.One of the quickest and cheapest solutions to draw carbon from the atmosphere is to plant trees. There is huge potential on planet Earth to replant areas that were once forested with trees and to start the biggest carbon capture and storage project we can currently conceive of.There is some controversy about the vast reported potential of tree planting. Scientists are not all in agreement about how much tree planting can contribute to climate solutions. It matters what kinds of trees are planted where.Poorly-planned forests can decrease biodiversity if they replace other, richer habitats, swapping a climate problem for a biodiversity problem. Single species plantations, like the ubiquitous Sitka spruce, provide habitat for relatively few other species.Forests on the wrong kinds of soils can lead to the release of carbon from peaty, carbon-rich soils. Highly flammable tree species planted in fire prone and warming regions can lead to rapid carbon cycling between trees and the atmosphere that provides few long-term carbon benefits.Effective use of forests as nature-based solutions for our climate woes requires a long view, both backwards in time and forwards in time. We need accurate whole of life-cycle carbon accounting and biodiversity monitoring to track the net carbon and nature gains from planting certain tree species in particular locations.While there may be new ways developed to draw down carbon from the atmosphere, designing the right kinds of forests in the right places to capture and store carbon is currently as close as we are likely to get to making diamonds from air.Yvonne Buckley is an ecologist and Professor of Zoology at Trinity College DublinOak trees in Phoenix Park.

43,https://www.desmogblog.com/2020/03/06/western-energy-alliance-ad-oil-gas-criminal,felbl7,"Oil Execs, Anxious About Public Support, Claim Halting Fossil Fuel Production Would Be 'Criminal' - DeSmog","A new oil and gas industry ad pushes back against growing calls to hold the fossil fuel industry accountable for the climate crisis — by making the bold statement that it would be criminal not to produce oil and gas.The ad by the industry trade group Western Energy Alliance (WEA) takes the form of an open letter to 2020 Democratic presidential candidates and is signed by 54 oil and gas company executives. It calls out Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, and former Vice President Joe Biden, who have all said they believe the industry should face accountability.Sanders said fossil fuel executives could be held criminally liable, and Biden said at a recent debate in Nevada that fossil fuel companies should be sued, “just like we did the drug companies, just like we did with the tobacco companies.”According to a survey by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, half of Americans support their local officials filing a liability lawsuit against fossil fuel companies, and 53 percent say that these companies should pay for all or most of the costs of climate damage.Fossil fuel executives should be criminally prosecuted for the destruction they have knowingly caused. #GreenNewDeal— Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) August 22, 2019But the Western Energy Alliance’s open letter, which ran as a full-page ad in The New York Times on February 24, fiercely defends oil and gas and deflects calls for holding the industry accountable. “Sen. Sanders calls us criminal and Vice President Biden says he would put us in jail, but it would be criminal not to produce the life-sustaining energy that enables a healthy, safe and modern lifestyle,” said Kathleen Sgamma, president of Western Energy Alliance.There is a lot to unpack in that statement, but as several sources told DeSmog, WEA’s messaging indicates the industry is desperate to defend its public image.“As a legal matter this claim is laughable so it’s better thought of as a PR stunt,” said Douglas Kysar, professor of law at Yale Law School. “The oil and gas industry seems to realize that its products are being recognized as deadly by growing portions of the world community and is trying to salvage their image with this ploy.”“They can see their social license to operate slipping away, and they’re scrambling to hold on as long as they can. They must be scared,” added Geoffrey Supran, a Harvard research associate who studies the history of fossil fuel disinformation. “Propaganda campaigns like this ad are the flagging fossil fuel industry’s predictable response.”Dear 2020 Candidates: It would be criminal NOT TO produce the reliable, affordable energy that keeps people warm in winter, cool in summer, and gets them to school to learn and work to provide for their families. #OilandGasBenefits #DemDebates https://t.co/kgkrnvTKoo #copolitics pic.twitter.com/SjjbkNTX1n— WesternEnergy1 (@WesternEnergy1) February 24, 2020DeSmog reached out to Western Energy Alliance for a response, and Sgamma refuted the labeling of industry campaigns like this ad as propaganda. “I challenge you to find anything in our ad that is incorrect,” she said.Merriam-Webster defines propaganda as “the spreading of ideas, information, or rumor for the purpose of helping or injuring an institution, a cause, or a person.”With that in mind, let’s take a closer look at this open letter and the arguments it makes in defense of oil and gas.The open letter advertisement is filled with false claims and misleading industry talking points. Here are five examples, each followed by a response explaining why it is problematic.Claim #1: Oil and gas are essential and society cannot function without these fuels. According to the WEA letter, “Without our energy, the lights go dark, and smart phones go silent. Medicines and medical devices cease to cure the sick and injured. Food cannot be grown and grocery store shelves go bare.”First of all, none of the presidential candidates, including those who support a fracking ban, are saying that fossil fuel production and usage should be halted immediately, as this warning seems to imply. While the world is still subsidizing fossil fuel development, the electric power system is undergoing a rapid transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. The electricity that powers modern life is increasingly supplied by renewable, carbon-free sources such as wind, water, and sunlight, and analyses show that the U.S. and the world can indeed ramp up to run entirely on these alternative energy sources.“What [oil and gas executives] don’t seem to understand is that fossil fuels are not the only source of energy,” explained Stanford researcher Ben Franta. “Indeed, averting catastrophic global warming requires the replacement of fossil fuels as quickly as possible. Oil barons’ denial of that fact won’t change it.”Claim #2: Natural gas is clean. “The clean-burning natural gas we produce helps improve air quality and lowers greenhouse gas emissions.”The oil and gas industry frequently touts gas as a “clean” fuel due to the fact that it produces fewer emissions of CO2 and other air pollutants when burned for electricity, compared to coal. But burning gas still produces these pollutants, which include smog precursors, and a growing body of research shows that gas has an even larger carbon footprint and is worse for the climate than coal, when considering the methane emissions associated with gas production.According to a recent study published in the journal Nature, oil and gas production has had a greater climate impact than previously understood, with methane emissions underestimated by up to 40 percent. Greater reliance on gas has also contributed to carbon emissions reaching a record high in 2019, according to research led by Stanford University and published in December. The growing use of gas, even as coal has declined, accounts for 60 percent of the rise in fossil fuel emissions from the past three years.As you read the section of the letter that says. “the clean burning natural gas we produce helps improve air quality and lowers greenhouse gas emissions” … enjoy video from Texas of big oil flaring natural gas directly into the air. https://t.co/VkPHYCzYeS pic.twitter.com/69czdontfF— Cal Perry (@CalNBC) February 24, 2020When including the full life cycle, natural gas, referred to by some as “fossil gas,” also does not help improve air quality, and the production process — including drilling, fracking, and pumping the gas through compressor stations — actually has adverse impacts on health and air quality. One study published last year that examined available data from compressor stations in New York found significant emissions of hazardous air pollutants including 39 chemicals that are known carcinogens. As the authors of this study, from the State University of New York at Albany, point out in their discussion, “natural gas is still not a ‘clean’ fuel. It still produces greenhouse gases, particulates, and volatile organic compounds when combusted.”Claim #3: Fossil fuels help lift people out of poverty. “By exporting our clean, abundant natural gas, we can help lift out of poverty the one billion people worldwide without access to electricity.”This idea that fossil fuel executives are determined to help alleviate global energy poverty has been repeated by former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as well as the coal industry, among others. And as DeSmog has previously reported, the evidence to support this claim is sometimes undermined by the same executives. “The track record of the industry certainly looks like a group focused more on making money than helping lift the developing world out of poverty,” DeSmog’s Justin Mikulka wrote, noting both Tillerson’s stated philosophy “is to make money” and Exxon’s experience exploiting oil in Equatorial Guinea while leaving the vast majority of the population impoverished.Rex Tillerson Credit: GreatAgain.govIn claiming to care about impoverished people in developing nations, such as those in Africa, fossil fuel executives fail to acknowledge that the climate impacts of using their products will substantially and disproportionately harm these people.Climate journalist and HEATED publisher Emily Atkin recently addressed this point in her newsletter: “Africa is the most vulnerable continent to climate change under all scenarios above 1.5 degrees Celsius. That means that if we fail to address climate change, African people will suffer most. Period. Climate deniers never address that reality; they just continue to say ‘Fossil fuels improve peoples’ lives,’ as the ocean acidifies and croplands shrivel and Australia burns and billions of locusts take over East Africa.”Translation: 54 oil/gas executives are climate science deniers https://t.co/dG7Jy3Xswi— Emily Atkin (@emorwee) February 24, 2020Energy, not fossil fuels, is what helps alleviate poverty, and fossil fuels are not the only source of energy. Meanwhile, people in developing countries are increasingly turning to renewable energy sources like solar power.Claim #4: Oil and gas are “life-sustaining,” and help prevent thousands of deaths during cold weather.The WEA’s open letter describes oil and gas as “life-sustaining” and the accompanying press release mentions that “abundant supplies of American natural gas have kept home heating prices so low that 11,000 deaths are averted annually during cold weather.” This narrow talking point ignores the broader context that fossil fuel pollution sickens and kills many more people than that every year. A recent report estimates that 4.5 million deaths globally and 230,000 deaths in the U.S. annually are linked to fossil fuel air pollution. And again, gas and oil are not the only sources for heating homes. Solar, geothermal, pellet stoves, and heat pumps are all cleaner alternatives.According to another study on fossil fuels and air pollution, published in April 2019 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, air pollution kills more people each year than smoking, and fossil fuel-related emissions account for 65 percent of these deaths attributable to air pollution. Phasing out fossil fuels would help prevent 3.6 million premature deaths worldwide each year, according to this study.The economic and health costs of air pollution from burning fossil fuels totaled $2.9 trillion in 2018, according to a new report. The cost represents 3.3 percent of global GDP, or about $8 billion per day. https://t.co/GMXFe81d0o pic.twitter.com/dNmH2BCLDx— Yale Environment 360 (@YaleE360) February 12, 2020Yet another study, published February 2017 in Environmental Health Perspectives, shows that fossil fuel emissions are harmful, particularly for the health of children. “The data summarized here show that by sharply reducing our dependence on fossil fuels we would achieve highly significant health and economic benefits for our children and their future,” the study states.“Fossil-fuel combustion by-products are the world’s most significant threat to children’s health and future,” according to a paper published by a Columbia University children’s health expert. The peer-reviewed research documenting the harmful, even deadly, impacts of fossil fuels is well established.Claim #5: Democratic candidates’ plans would kill millions of jobs and force America to import foreign energy. “Were we to be prosecuted, as you promise, and forced to stop providing our life-sustaining products, 10.3 million jobs and hundreds of billions of dollars would be sent overseas to import the energy that Americans rely on.”The fossil fuel industry has repeatedly pointed to potential job losses as a defense, but today there are more jobs in clean energy than in fossil fuels. According to one analysis published last year, the number of jobs in clean energy outnumber fossil fuel jobs nearly 3 to 1. And, contrary to the claim that jobs would be sent overseas, the Democratic candidates targeted in this ad are actually calling for massive job creation in America in building the clean economy. While Elizabeth Warren suspended her campaign this week, her climate plans, for example, were estimated to generate over $10 trillion in new wealth and create more than 10 million new jobs. Bernie Sanders’ plan for a Green New Deal similarly would seek to create 20 million new jobs.Several experts in climate change accountability and industry deception told DeSmog that the Western Energy Alliance ad is just the latest example of deceptively false messaging by the fossil fuel industry whose product fuels the climate crisis.“For decades, fossil fuel company executives faced with the harmful effects of their products have responded by distorting the truth in an effort to evade accountability. This ad is the latest manifestation of that strategy,” said Kathy Mulvey, accountability campaign director in the climate and energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “It falsely claims that there is no alternative to oil and gas and misrepresents these fossil fuels as ‘life-sustaining products’ despite their role in driving global warming emissions upward and despite the cost effectiveness, economic growth, and jobs related to renewable energy and clean vehicle technologies.”A 2015 protest in Washington, D.C. Credit: Flickr/Johnny Silvercloud, CC BY–SA 2.0“The oil and gas industry has a long track record of using the media to lie about its products. But expensive advertising campaigns can’t greenwash the truth — fossil fuels are accelerating our global climate crisis while poisoning communities,” Keith Slack, director of strategic impact at EarthRights International, emphasized.Harvard’s Supran called the claim that natural gas is “clean” blatantly false advertising. “I’d also note that the ad is essentially a public relations effort to misdirect audiences from the actual assertions of the Democratic nominees, which are that if fossil fuel firms knowingly misled the public or shareholders about the global warming dangers of their products, they should be held accountable,” he said.Supran and Mulvey both mentioned that oil giant BP recently announced it would be cutting ties with several trade associations including Western Energy Alliance. “Just two days after the Western Energy Alliance ran this ad, BP announced its decision to leave the group because it is not aligned with the company’s position on federal regulation of methane,” Mulvey explained. “If other fossil fuel companies want to avoid a backlash from climate-conscious investors and activists, they should quickly break with WEA and publicly repudiate its climate disinformation.”The bottom line, as Stanford’s Ben Franta explained, is that the fossil fuel industry cannot escape the weight of evidence showing it knowingly misled the public on the dangers of its product.“From the industry’s own internal documents, we know that oil companies have privately known since the 1980s — and even before — that their products, if not replaced, would cause global catastrophe,” he said. “Instead of warning the world and working to develop sustainable energy sources, the oil industry deceived the public and blocked solutions — all for a buck. Now the bill is coming due. Oil industry heads can take out all the full page ads they like, but they won’t escape history, science, or the law.”Main image: California Oil and Gas.

The ad by the industry trade group Western Energy Alliance (WEA) takes the form of an open letter to 2020 Democratic presidential candidates and is signed by 54 oil and gas company executives. It calls out Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, and former Vice President Joe Biden, who have all said they believe the industry should face accountability. Sanders said fossil fuel executives could be held criminally liable, and Biden said at a recent debate in Nevada that fossil fuel companies should be sued, “just like we did the drug companies, just like we did with the tobacco companies.” According to a survey by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, half of Americans support their local officials filing a liability lawsuit against fossil fuel companies, and 53 percent say that these companies should pay for all or most of the costs of climate damage. Fossil fuel executives should be criminally prosecuted for the destruction they have knowingly caused. #GreenNewDeal — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) August 22, 2019 But the Western Energy Alliance’s open letter, which ran as a full-page ad in The New York Times on February 24, fiercely defends oil and gas and deflects calls for holding the industry accountable. “Sen. Sanders calls us criminal and Vice President Biden says he would put us in jail, but it would be criminal not to produce the life-sustaining energy that enables a healthy, safe and modern lifestyle,” said Kathleen Sgamma, president of Western Energy Alliance. There is a lot to unpack in that statement, but as several sources told DeSmog, WEA’s messaging indicates the industry is desperate to defend its public image. “As a legal matter this claim is laughable so it’s better thought of as a PR stunt,” said Douglas Kysar, professor of law at Yale Law School. “The oil and gas industry seems to realize that its products are being recognized as deadly by growing portions of the world community and is trying to salvage their image with this ploy.” “They can see their social license to operate slipping away, and they’re scrambling to hold on as long as they can. They must be scared,” added Geoffrey Supran, a Harvard research associate who studies the history of fossil fuel disinformation. “Propaganda campaigns like this ad are the flagging fossil fuel industry’s predictable response.” Dear 2020 Candidates: It would be criminal NOT TO produce the reliable, affordable energy that keeps people warm in winter, cool in summer, and gets them to school to learn and work to provide for their families. #OilandGasBenefits #DemDebates https://t.co/kgkrnvTKoo #copolitics pic.twitter.com/SjjbkNTX1n — WesternEnergy1 (@WesternEnergy1) February 24, 2020 DeSmog reached out to Western Energy Alliance for a response, and Sgamma refuted the labeling of industry campaigns like this ad as propaganda. “I challenge you to find anything in our ad that is incorrect,” she said. Merriam-Webster defines propaganda as “the spreading of ideas, information, or rumor for the purpose of helping or injuring an institution, a cause, or a person.” With that in mind, let’s take a closer look at this open letter and the arguments it makes in defense of oil and gas. Debunking the Industry Defenses of Oil and Gas The open letter advertisement is filled with false claims and misleading industry talking points. Here are five examples, each followed by a response explaining why it is problematic. Claim #1: Oil and gas are essential and society cannot function without these fuels. According to the WEA letter, “Without our energy, the lights go dark, and smart phones go silent. Medicines and medical devices cease to cure the sick and injured. Food cannot be grown and grocery store shelves go bare.” First of all, none of the presidential candidates, including those who support a fracking ban, are saying that fossil fuel production and usage should be halted immediately, as this warning seems to imply. While the world is still subsidizing fossil fuel development, the electric power system is undergoing a rapid transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. The electricity that powers modern life is increasingly supplied by renewable, carbon-free sources such as wind, water, and sunlight, and analyses show that the U.S. and the world can indeed ramp up to run entirely on these alternative energy sources. “What [oil and gas executives] don’t seem to understand is that fossil fuels are not the only source of energy,” explained Stanford researcher Ben Franta. “Indeed, averting catastrophic global warming requires the replacement of fossil fuels as quickly as possible. Oil barons’ denial of that fact won’t change it.” Claim #2: Natural gas is clean. “The clean-burning natural gas we produce helps improve air quality and lowers greenhouse gas emissions.” The oil and gas industry frequently touts gas as a “clean” fuel due to the fact that it produces fewer emissions of CO2 and other air pollutants when burned for electricity, compared to coal. But burning gas still produces these pollutants, which include smog precursors, and a growing body of research shows that gas has an even larger carbon footprint and is worse for the climate than coal, when considering the methane emissions associated with gas production. According to a recent study published in the journal Nature, oil and gas production has had a greater climate impact than previously understood, with methane emissions underestimated by up to 40 percent.

It appeared destined for quick passage until hitting a roadblock on amendment language calling for regulations on the globe-warming hydrofluorocarbons used in refrigerators and air conditioners. The legislation failed to gather the majority support needed to close debate on the bill in a March 9 vote.The debate continues, then, on the legislation. U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), the bill’s co-sponsor, expressed irritation over the bill’s status.“It is beyond frustrating to have our bill, which contains priorities from more than 70 Senators, held up by an unrelated dispute that was never part of our discussions in the lead-up to this floor process,” she said in a press release. “We will regroup and look for a path forward, but finding one will require members to be more reasonable and accommodating than they have been in the last week, and certainly more so than they were today.”Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski speaking in support of the Senate energy bill on March 8, 2020. Credit: Sen. Lisa Murkowski on FacebookThe legislation has thus far received bipartisan support because it contains subsidies for renewable energy sources including wind, solar, and geothermal. It also creates federal financial incentives for creating energy-efficient buildings and boosts funding for energy storage. For that, it has garnered lobbying support from the likes of the American Council on Renewable Energy, the Nature Conservancy, and the Environmental Defense Fund.Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) called for support of the bill during March 2 remarks on the Senate floor.“This bill provides a real test for Senate Republicans,” said Schumer. “Will they join Senate Democrats in fighting for and passing bipartisan legislation that will address climate change in a significant way, or will our Republican friends continue to do what they have done for the last several years — do the bidding of corporate polluters and Big Oil?”Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) praised the legislation, too, while deriding the Green New Deal.“The Green New Deal sought to have Washington, D.C. micromanage everyday life in this country to a degree that the 20th-century socialists would have drooled over,” he said in a March 3 speech made on the Senate floor. “Instead, this bipartisan legislation will create better policy and regulatory conditions for American workers, American innovators, and American job creators to thrive.”The act has garnered widespread fossil fuel industry approval from organizations such as the American Gas Association, American Petroleum Institute, industry front group the Consumer Energy Alliance, the petrochemical trade association the American Chemistry Council, the National Mining Association, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and a slew of others.Outside of the renewable energy, energy efficiency, and energy storage clauses, the energy bill contains provisions aiming to ease the way for exports of so-called “small scale” LNG export terminals, which rely on slightly smaller tankers and keep the LNG in liquid form instead of re-gasifying it.The Senate bill also offers over $367.8 million in federal funding through 2024 to test out a geoengineering pilot project for a technique called direct air capture, which involves vacuuming carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Geoengineering is a proposal to use various technologies with goals of either removing greenhouse gases already emitted or reversing global warming.Credit: Energy.Senate.GovThe LNG exports provision in the bill, originally introduced as the Small Scale LNG Access Act in March 2019, has received lobbying support from the Independent Petroleum Association of America, Siemens, and the gas production company EOG Resources, according to disclosure forms. Siemens is a producer of small-scale LNG equipment through its subsidiary, Dresser Rand, with much of the small scale LNG exports currently destined for Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico contracted out its post-Hurricane Maria electricity sector assessment completed in early 2019 to none other than Siemens.The legislation contains another provision calling for $1.472 billion in subsidies for a “large scale” carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) project for a coal-fired power plant. Originally dubbed the Fossil Energy Utilization, Enhancement, and Leadership Act, the bill received lobbying support from the Coal Utilization Research Council. The group’s members include coal giant Peabody Energy; utility giants Edison Electric Institute, Southern Company, and Duke Energy; the American Coal Council, and others.Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is an expensive endeavor linking power plants to the capture and burial of carbon emissions underground, known in industry lingo as sequestration. Despite numerous attempts at development and billions of dollars poured into research, most CCS projects have failed. One of them, owned by Coal Utilization Research Council member Southern Company, went out of business in 2017 after receiving more than $700 million in federal subsidies. Existing CCS projects, which are energy-intensive, primarily use captured carbon dioxide to pump more oil out of old wells. A 2018 Reuters poll of the top 10 U.S. utilities found little interest in investing in CCS projects, even with federal incentives.Beyond CCS, the bill also has a provision calling for the U.S. Department of Energy to study the potential creation of a petrochemical storage hub near the Marcellus Shale basin in Appalachia. The Appalachian Energy for National Security Act provision calls on the “Secretary of Energy to conduct a study on the national security implications of building ethane and other natural-gas-liquids-related petrochemical infrastructure” in the Appalachian region. The bill, which received lobbying support from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, was first introduced by West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, a long-time promoter of such a project and co-sponsor of the larger Senate energy bill.Senators have also introduced 220 different amendments to the bill, which include the one calling for a phase-out of hydrofluorocarbons from cooling and refrigeration devices. Three of the amendments, if passed, would greatly expand drilling in North Dakota’s Bakken Shale basin.Two of them received an introduction by U.S. Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-ND), who served as an energy policy aide for President Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. One of these amendments, successfully inserted into the bill, calls for the U.S. Department of Energy to do a “Bakken and Three Forks Natural Gas Liquids Report” to study the potential for a petrochemical storage hub in the Bakken. The other, titled “Bakken Energy for National Security,” calls for the Energy Department to do a similar study with the U.S. Department of Defense and U.S. Treasury Department to “assess … the potential national and economic security impacts of building ethane and other natural-gas-liquids-related petrochemical infrastructure in the geographical vicinity of the Bakken.”The third amendment, introduced by U.S. Sen. John Hoeven (R-ND), calls for expedited permitting for drilling on U.S. public lands located within the Bakken. The provision is known as the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Spacing Act.Credit: Congress.govThe North Dakota Pipeline Authority is currently teaming up with the University of North Dakota’s Energy and Environmental Research Center to study the potential for a petrochemical hub in the region, as well.

Called the American Energy Innovation Act, the 600-page bill is a compilation of 50 bills previously introduced by members of Congress. It appeared destined for quick passage until hitting a roadblock on amendment language calling for regulations on the globe-warming hydrofluorocarbons used in refrigerators and air conditioners. The legislation failed to gather the majority support needed to close debate on the bill in a March 9 vote. The debate continues, then, on the legislation. U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), the bill’s co-sponsor, expressed irritation over the bill’s status. “It is beyond frustrating to have our bill, which contains priorities from more than 70 Senators, held up by an unrelated dispute that was never part of our discussions in the lead-up to this floor process,” she said in a press release. “We will regroup and look for a path forward, but finding one will require members to be more reasonable and accommodating than they have been in the last week, and certainly more so than they were today.” Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski speaking in support of the Senate energy bill on March 8, 2020. Credit: Sen. Lisa Murkowski on Facebook Bipartisan Uptake, Industry Praise The legislation has thus far received bipartisan support because it contains subsidies for renewable energy sources including wind, solar, and geothermal. It also creates federal financial incentives for creating energy-efficient buildings and boosts funding for energy storage. For that, it has garnered lobbying support from the likes of the American Council on Renewable Energy, the Nature Conservancy, and the Environmental Defense Fund. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) called for support of the bill during March 2 remarks on the Senate floor. “This bill provides a real test for Senate Republicans,” said Schumer. “Will they join Senate Democrats in fighting for and passing bipartisan legislation that will address climate change in a significant way, or will our Republican friends continue to do what they have done for the last several years — do the bidding of corporate polluters and Big Oil?” Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) praised the legislation, too, while deriding the Green New Deal. “The Green New Deal sought to have Washington, D.C. micromanage everyday life in this country to a degree that the 20th-century socialists would have drooled over,” he said in a March 3 speech made on the Senate floor. “Instead, this bipartisan legislation will create better policy and regulatory conditions for American workers, American innovators, and American job creators to thrive.” The act has garnered widespread fossil fuel industry approval from organizations such as the American Gas Association, American Petroleum Institute, industry front group the Consumer Energy Alliance, the petrochemical trade association the American Chemistry Council, the National Mining Association, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and a slew of others. Dirty Details Outside of the renewable energy, energy efficiency, and energy storage clauses, the energy bill contains provisions aiming to ease the way for exports of so-called “small scale” LNG export terminals, which rely on slightly smaller tankers and keep the LNG in liquid form instead of re-gasifying it. The Senate bill also offers over $367.8 million in federal funding through 2024 to test out a geoengineering pilot project for a technique called direct air capture, which involves vacuuming carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Geoengineering is a proposal to use various technologies with goals of either removing greenhouse gases already emitted or reversing global warming. Credit: Energy.Senate.Gov The LNG exports provision in the bill, originally introduced as the Small Scale LNG Access Act in March 2019, has received lobbying support from the Independent Petroleum Association of America, Siemens, and the gas production company EOG Resources, according to disclosure forms. Siemens is a producer of small-scale LNG equipment through its subsidiary, Dresser Rand, with much of the small scale LNG exports currently destined for Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico contracted out its post-Hurricane Maria electricity sector assessment completed in early 2019 to none other than Siemens. The legislation contains another provision calling for $1.472 billion in subsidies for a “large scale” carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) project for a coal-fired power plant. Originally dubbed the Fossil Energy Utilization, Enhancement, and Leadership Act, the bill received lobbying support from the Coal Utilization Research Council. The group’s members include coal giant Peabody Energy; utility giants Edison Electric Institute, Southern Company, and Duke Energy; the American Coal Council, and others. Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is an expensive endeavor linking power plants to the capture and burial of carbon emissions underground, known in industry lingo as sequestration. Despite numerous attempts at development and billions of dollars poured into research, most CCS projects have failed. One of them, owned by Coal Utilization Research Council member Southern Company, went out of business in 2017 after receiving more than $700 million in federal subsidies. Existing CCS projects, which are energy-intensive, primarily use captured carbon dioxide to pump more oil out of old wells. A 2018 Reuters poll of the top 10 U.S. utilities found little interest in investing in CCS projects, even with federal incentives. Beyond CCS, the bill also has a provision calling for the U.S. Department of Energy to study the potential creation of a petrochemical storage hub near the Marcellus Shale basin in Appalachia. The Appalachian Energy for National Security Act provision calls on the “Secretary of Energy to conduct a study on the national security implications of building ethane and other natural-gas-liquids-related petrochemical infrastructure” in the Appalachian region. The bill, which received lobbying support from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, was first introduced by West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, a long-time promoter of such a project and co-sponsor of the larger Senate energy bill. Bakken Petrochemical Hub Senators have also introduced 220 different amendments to the bill, which include the one calling for a phase-out of hydrofluorocarbons from cooling and refrigeration devices. Three of the amendments, if passed, would greatly expand drilling in North Dakota’s Bakken Shale basin. Two of them received an introduction by U.S. Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-ND), who served as an energy policy aide for President Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. One of these amendments, successfully inserted into the bill, calls for the U.S. Department of Energy to do a “Bakken and Three Forks Natural Gas Liquids Report” to study the potential for a petrochemical storage hub in the Bakken. The other, titled “Bakken Energy for National Security,” calls for the Energy Department to do a similar study with the U.S. Department of Defense and U.S. Treasury Department to “assess … the potential national and economic security impacts of building ethane and other natural-gas-liquids-related petrochemical infrastructure in the geographical vicinity of the Bakken.” Credit: Energy.Senate.Gov The third amendment, introduced by U.S. Sen. John Hoeven (R-ND), calls for expedited permitting for drilling on U.S. public lands located within the Bakken. The provision is known as the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Spacing Act. Credit: Congress.gov The North Dakota Pipeline Authority is currently teaming up with the University of North Dakota’s Energy and Environmental Research Center to study the potential for a petrochemical hub in the region, as well. That study is set for release on May 1, the publication Prairie Public Broadcasting reported. “The petrochemical industry is the number one consumer of those natural gas liquids,” Justin Kringstad, Executive Director of the North Dakota Pipeline Authority, told Prairie Public Broadcasting in October. “As investors and companies look at North Dakota for opportunities, we need to have good, solid scientific data we can point to, and have a good understanding of this resource potential.” The oil and gas industry sees the growth of plastics manufacturing, as well as exporting LNG and building gas power plants in the U.S., as a profitable lifeline to continue fracking in places like the Bakken Shale and the Marcellus.

No, it's not,"" said Adam Matthews, co-chair of TPI.""There are ones that have more comprehensive commitments that put them on a path much closer to two degrees than some of the others.""Shell is classed as the most ambitious of the companies assessed and are the closest to a 2C warming scenario.However, despite Shell's stated commitment to having a net-zero energy business by 2050, TPI says that ""the claim that it will be aligned with a 1.5C climate scenario is not consistent with our analysis.""The authors say that they have not been able to assess Shell's plan to sell only its energy products to companies that are committed to net zero.""We can't yet quantify that,"" said Adam Matthews.""But that potentially is very significant. And does get them to a sort of one and a half degree of warming kind of commitment, which is equivalent to net zero.""According to the authors, a genuine net zero strategy for the average European oil and gas company would require 100% emissions cuts between now and 2050.TPI point out that all of the plans they have assessed are, to some degree, dependent on carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology and nature-based solutions such as planting trees.""There are very significant assumptions that need further probing,"" said Adam Matthews.""And we obviously need greater understanding of the role that that these will play in delivering these strategies.""Four of the companies assessed, Shell, Eni, Total and Repsol, are now aligned with the pledges made under the Paris climate agreement.However, the authors draw a sharp contrast between the actions of these European companies and oil and gas producers in the US.None of the dozens of American fossil fuel corporations have public disclosures on climate change comparable to Europe, which TPI says is a concern.""We simply don't know what their intentions are on this issue, that poses a greater financial risk to us,"" said Adam Matthews.""We're continuing to engage, but engagements are finite, there comes a point at which you have to draw very clear conclusions.""Follow Matt on Twitter.ShareSaveMatt McGrathEnvironment correspondentGetty ImagesClimate change: Study pours cold water on oil company net zero claims12 May 2020 Share Save Matt McGrath Environment correspondentOil and Gas UK (OGUK) wants action from the UK government to allow businesses in its sector to access finance to help them through the Covid-19 crisisCan coronavirus crisis spur a green recovery?

Together with five others scheduled to launch in late 2022 outside Moscow and in central Russia’s republic of Tatarstan, Greenpeace estimates the plants will spew 5 million metric tons of toxic waste every year.“Local residents will go on strike,” the environmental NGO said in a statement. “They don’t want to risk the health of their children, who will have to breathe the harmful emissions.”Greenpeace also warned that the plants will increase Russia’s dependency on plastic and delay its move toward reusable materials.Environmental activists previously criticized Moscow city authorities’ plans to equate waste incineration with recycling in their trash reform plan for the next decade.Rostec disputed Greenpeace’s assessment, calling its technology “the most widespread and well-researched in the world [and] the most ecologically clean and safe for the environment and the population.”“Myths about the dangers of waste-to-energy plants apply to older-generation plants,” Interfax quoted Rostec’s press service as saying Thursday.The backlash toward the waste-incineration plants is the latest issue in Russia’s struggle to reform its waste management system. Russians across the country have rallied since fall 2018 against Moscow’s plans to export its waste to more remote and less populated regions.This story was updated at 1:04 p.m. on May 18 to clarify Greenpeace's warning that waste-to-power plants could delay Russia’s move toward reusable materials, not biodegradable materials.A Message from The Moscow Times:Dear readers,We are facing unprecedented challenges.

Kirill Kukhmar/TASS Russia’s ambitious plans to build 25 waste-burning power plants risk provoking social unrest over their environmental and financial costs, Greenpeace Russia warned Thursday. State industrial conglomerate Rostec, state nuclear agency Rosatom and the VEB state development corporation on Thursday announced a 600 billion ruble ($7.6 billion) project to build the 25 waste-to-energy plants in “Russia’s largest tourist centers.” NEWS Moscow’s Trash Reform Equates Incineration With Recycling READ MORE Greenpeace warned that the public could end up paying for the plants’ construction at least in part while also facing higher energy costs as consumers. Together with five others scheduled to launch in late 2022 outside Moscow and in central Russia’s republic of Tatarstan, Greenpeace estimates the plants will spew 5 million metric tons of toxic waste every year. “Local residents will go on strike,” the environmental NGO said in a statement. “They don’t want to risk the health of their children, who will have to breathe the harmful emissions.” Greenpeace also warned that the plants will increase Russia’s dependency on plastic and delay its move toward reusable materials. Environmental activists previously criticized Moscow city authorities’ plans to equate waste incineration with recycling in their trash reform plan for the next decade. Rostec disputed Greenpeace’s assessment, calling its technology “the most widespread and well-researched in the world [and] the most ecologically clean and safe for the environment and the population.” “Myths about the dangers of waste-to-energy plants apply to older-generation plants,” Interfax quoted Rostec’s press service as saying Thursday. The backlash toward the waste-incineration plants is the latest issue in Russia’s struggle to reform its waste management system. Russians across the country have rallied since fall 2018 against Moscow’s plans to export its waste to more remote and less populated regions. This story was updated at 1:04 p.m. on May 18 to clarify Greenpeace's warning that waste-to-power plants could delay Russia’s move toward reusable materials, not biodegradable materials.

The current container for the potato-based snack was condemned as a recycler's nightmare. It's a complex construction with a metal base, plastic cap, metal tear-off lid, and foil-lined cardboard sleeve. The Recycling Association dubbed it the number one recycling villain -- along with the Lucozade Sports bottle. Now Pringles' maker Kellogg's is trialling a simpler can -- although experts say it's not a full solution. The existing version is particularly troublesome because it combines so many different materials Some 90% of the new can is paper. Around 10% is a polyal (plastic) barrier that seals the interior to protect the food against oxygen and moisture which would damage the taste. But how about the lid? Well, two options are on trial in some Tesco stores -- a recyclable plastic lid and a recyclable paper lid. Kellogg's says these lids will still produce the distinctive ""pop"" associated with the product. [Simon Ellin from the Recycling Association] said the polyal-coated card might be recyclable but the product would need to be tested in recycling mills. And what of the much-criticised Lucozade Sports bottle? Mr Ellin said its unchanged basic design was still a big problem, as machines found it hard to differentiate the plastic in the bottle and the plastic that makes up its outer sleeve. He called on the makers, Suntory, to reduce the size of the external sleeve, as it has with the new Ribena bottle."

At 361 feet in length, and carrying both a submarine and myCopter craft, the design places autonomous exploration at the top of the agenda. If Sting was in the market for a Feadship, Escape would be it.It all began in 2014 when Feadship’s senior designer Ruud Bakker and his team invited a bunch of brokers to sit down and dream up their perfect custom yacht. At the heart of their proposition was an imaginary extrovert client with green fingers and a love of the planet. Over the course of three days curvaceous lines began to take shape and Escape emerged from the drawing boards. But far from fairytale sketches, it’s a serious design underpinned by viable naval architecture.The most radical, eye-catching feature is the atrium in the center of the yacht that includes a wellness area and a moon pool with seawater. It also doubles as an elevator shaft. The glass surround elevator descends to the bottom of the moon pool and serves as an underwater observation pod in place of a traditional owner’s lounge.Different features like 7,500 square feet of solar panels, a greenery and hybrid propulsion could be game-changers for the superyacht segment. Courtesy Feadship“The elevator gives guests a 360-degree view with fish swimming all around,” Bakker told Robb Report, “so you can imagine that when you switch on the lights you attract all the marine life and it’s as though you’re standing in the middle of a fish tank.”The moon pool is also a submarine landing zone for exploration below depths, while a giant slide for inter-deck splashes will keep the kids happy. But the clear aim of the atrium, aside from its Bond-like gadgetry, is to test the limitations of yacht design.“These blue-sky days with brokers help us to keep pushing the boundaries and to offer the things that others say no to,” says Bakker. “We say yes, and I think that’s what sets us apart from any other shipyard.”The Moon Pool, which has a glass bottom and runs through the center of the hull, is a design that Escape’s naval architects wanted to prove would be feasible. Courtesy FeadshipThe green innovations include an enthalpy wheel to pre-cool the AC intake with exhaust air, and the reheating of AC air with waste heat from the generators. Escape also has the same hybrid propulsion package found on Feadship’s Savannah. These all mount up to a 35 percent reduction in fuel consumption, along with the option for silent electric cruising. Feadship is so serious about pushing electric propulsion that it recently announced it will offer the package to owners at cost.“We only do electric propulsion now; owners don’t get anything else. And if you don’t want to pay for it then you get it at cost,” he says. “It’s a bold decision by us, but sustainability needs to start somewhere.”Around 7,500 square feet of solar panels cover the yacht, including a rotating deck hatch that tracks the sun’s rays throughout the day, generating an estimated 133 kW of energy. An abundance of greenery is also included, from the full-height tree in the sky lounge to an herb and vegetable “greenhouse.”The Zen-like feel of the sky lounge includes a full-sized tree for an owner with a green thumb. Courtesy FeadshipThe use of nature within Feadship’s recent concepts is becoming a common theme, as shown on its superyacht concept “Freedom.” Designed in collaboration with Italian studio FM Architettura, the idea behind the garden suites and holistic garden area is to extend the connection with the outdoors.“We mixed many elements here, blending nature’s habitat into the design, using skylights, gardens, water spaces, pools and more,” designer Francesca Muzio told Robb Report. “The holistic garden is a perfect and particular space to switch off, recharge and repair both body and soul.”Now, the concepts just need a rock-star like Sting to become the next owner.By JULIA ZALTZMANFew yachts are designed with an eco-conscious rock star in mind, but that’s exactly how Feadship’s revolutionary concept “Escape” came to be.

59,https://illuminem.com/energyvoices/e9ad1428-7636-4980-842a-0a4eeb332444,orx7y5,The ‘net-zero’ greenwash | illuminem,"By Ashish KothariJul 26 2021 · 10 min readEvery once in a while, a seductive term comes along to save the fortress of rulers from being taken down by disgruntled ‘subjects’. We’ve had concepts like ‘inclusive’, ‘sustainable’, and ‘participatory’, each hiding what is otherwise business as usual. The latest in this lineage is ‘net-zero’.With the climate crisis and biodiversity loss so clearly visible that they are becoming impossible to ignore or deny (Trumpism notwithstanding), there is a scramble for convenient solutions, especially in governments and corporations. Pathways that do not disturb the status quo are being sought and tread, strategies that do not challenge the current power dynamics in which nation-state governments and mega-corporations (including banks) control national and global economy, and yet appear to give them a nice green image. Net-zero has emerged as one of the favourites. It is likely to be pushed strongly in the upcoming Climate Conference of Parties (COP26) and is already part of the discussions around the Post-2020 Biodiversity Framework that is being negotiated under the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).In the case of climate, net-zero implies that if there is a certain amount of climate-changing emissions in one place, it can be ‘offset’ elsewhere in a number of ways, such as capturing the same amount in trees or the oceans. This does not necessarily entail reducing the emissions in the first place. For biodiversity, the equivalent is ‘no-net-loss’, which means that the loss of an ecosystem or species somewhere is compensated by regenerating or protecting anew a similar ecosystem or that species somewhere else.Suddenly, everyone is announcing net-zero or no-net-loss targets. G7 countries recently announced a collective target of reaching net-zero climate damaging emissions by 2050. In 2019, Amazon initiated the Climate Pledge, committing to become net-zero by 2040 – I am referring here to the company, not the forest, which, given deforestation rates, will probably be an absolute zero by end of century. A number of prominent academic institutions and civil society groups are also involved, such as Princeton and Stanford Universities in USA.Firstly, a mindset that equates pollution emitted or forest cut in one place to pollution absorbed or afforestation done elsewhere, is ecologically and socially ignorant (or will-fully negligent). This comes from a flawed view that the climate crisis is only about carbon and that a forest is only a collection of trees, a grassland a collection of grass, a wetland a body of water with fish in it. The emissions of a thermal power station are not only carbon dioxide, but other gases and liquid effluents, with their own hazards to human and environment health. How can capturing an equivalent amount of carbon somewhere else, possibly compensate for the other emissions (or for the impacts of associated activities such as coal mining, fracking, pipelines, transmission lines)? Similarly, in the case of biodiversity, a rainforest is a complex of thousands of species and varieties (many of which we may not even have yet identified or described), and there is no human mechanism that can it possibly be replicated elsewhere, certainly not in any short time-span. The same for complex grasslands, wetlands, coastal and marine areas, and other natural ecosystems.A precursor to this kind of approach has been used to justify the loss of ecosystems for so-called ‘development’ projects. For instance, in India, if a dam or mine or industry is given 100 hectares of forest land to clear and use, it has to do ‘compensatory afforestation’ of 200 hectares of non-forest land. This is purely a numbers game, with absolutely no consideration for the complexity, quality, and multiple values of the forest that will be cleared. The most ridiculous and ecologically bankrupt example of this is a recent decision to do compensatory afforestation for 20,000 hectares of rainforests being diverted in Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal – guess where? In central India, an area where none of the species typical of the islands can possibly be grown! I mean, would it be tolerated if one were to say, its ok to destroy the economy of one country, we’ll just make sure the economy of another country is upgraded?Second, as a recent civil society report exposing the net-zero scam points out, many of the proposals for achieving this target are based on unrealistic projections of land available, or technologies that are not yet viable. According to some calculations, there may simply not be enough ‘natural sinks’ (forests, seas, grasslands) to absorb existing and future emissions, and these ecosystems cannot be force-fed to absorb more or faster. Or if an attempt is made to do this it could create other ecological disasters. For instance, one of the ‘geoengineering’ (technological engineering at a global scale) solutions that has been proposed for many years is ‘fertilising’ the oceans with iron to increase planktons that would absorb carbon. Many scientists warn that this could set off unpredictable and potentially devastating chain effects on marine life, apart from ethically troubling considerations regarding possible impacts on people across the planet.Third, the common experience with all such approaches is that the targets are hardly ever met. Grand promises are made to justify continued or new emissions, or the clearing of an ecosystem, but subsequently it is found that as much land as is required, or the technologies needed, are simply not available. Inefficiency, corruption, and other all-too-frequent bugbears of the governmental or corporate system play their own part in this failure of implementation. In India, the amount of land required for compensatory afforestation has consistently lagged behind the amount of forest land diverted for non-forest use, and civil society reports indicate that substantial achievements of afforestation are more on paper than on the ground.Fourth, net-zero approaches do not take into consideration social, economic, and cultural impacts, both of the activities that are causing emissions or biodiversity loss as also of the compensatory activities. I recall that four decades back when we were campaigning against thermal power stations in Delhi, we found that one of them was not only emitting huge amounts of pollution from its chimneys but also spreading dangerous coal dust into neighbouring rural areas with serious consequences for farming and the health of its residents. How will absorbing carbon somewhere else possibly reduce this ‘collateral damage’? If a forest or wetland on which a local community is dependent is cleared for a mining project, how can afforestation or regeneration of a wetlands elsewhere possibly compensate its loss of livelihoods and cultural-spiritual connections?And then where compensatory activities are taken up, it is often on lands which other farming, fishing, pastoral, crafts and other nature-dependent communities survive on, by displacing or dispossessing them. India’s compensatory afforestation scheme, mentioned above, has done this time and again. Even when the compensation is in the form of freshly protecting, say, one square kilometre of rainforest in one place for a square kilometre deforested somewhere else, it could have negative consequences for the communities living inside or dependent on that forest. This has been a common criticism of the 15-year old climate mitigation approach called REDD+ (Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation).According to Shell corporation, one of the world’s biggest climate polluters, for the world to reach net-zero about 700 million hectares of land (about the size of Brazil) will have to be reforested; chances are these will be lands on which communities are dependent for their livelihoods. With no curbs on overall and luxury energy demand, even renewable energy sources will be unsustainable, and have their own horrific impacts on ecosystems, wildlife and local communities. Amazon (the company) has in 2020 become the world’s biggest consumer of renewable energy – sounds good, but a closer look at how and where this enormous energy is produced and what impacts it has is likely to reveal an uglier picture.Fifth, as the above mentioned civil society report points out, “the vast majority of these (climate-related) plans are centred on a “net zero” by 2050 timeline with little action taken to reduce emissions at source for decades—far too long a timeline for a credible emissions reduction plan that ensures we keep global temperature rise to below 1.5 degrees Celsius. Many of these plans lack real benchmarks between now and 2050, which allows business as usual for decades before any action is required, and ignore basic principles of global equity, which demand that wealthier entities act fastest to reduce emissions and provide support for others to follow.”There is widespread scientific opinion that the only thing that will work is drastic decrease in emissions by 2030. But it does not appear that the biggest polluting countries and companies are committing to anything close to this. According to Carbon Brief, a website that has presented clear data and analysis on climate for some years, Shell corporation’s latest vision of net-zero called ‘Sky 1.5’, envisages continued use of oil, gas, and coal until the end of the century. India, while projecting itself as a global climate leader by committing to 450 GW of renewable energy by 2030 (on which it is well behind schedule), also continues to expand its fossil fuel extraction and production. In 2020, during the COVID lockdown, it auctioned 60 new coal mining blocks.As climate activist Greta Thunberg said in her characteristically forthright address to the Austrian World Summit on 2nd July:At the heart of this greenwash is an older phenomenon, that of pushing technological solutions to social, economic, political problems. With capitalist profits driving corporations, short-term political power fuelling the decisions of governments, an addiction to economic growth-based development remains at the base of national and international decisions. Anyone who questions this, even when backed by solid evidence of such approaches leading us to ecological and social catastrophe, is ignored; or if they happen to be defenders of their own lands and ecosystems, imprisoned, beaten up, even killed.It is not as if alternatives do not exist. They do, and are proven as viable in initiatives around the world. Decentralised renewable energy such as solar is now financially affordable (in many situations cheaper than fossil fuels). It needs to be accompanied with limits on luxury demand and the redistribution of existing energy to those who still don’t have enough. These are political issues, and require cultural change as well to give a sense of the injustice and unsustainability of demanding more and more energy (even if its ‘renewable’).Similarly, there are alternatives in all the sectors that are currently leading to climate change and biodiversity loss: transportation, construction, infrastructure, industrial production, home appliances, etc. A rapid move away from privatised motor vehicles to public transportation, cycling and walking, and ecologically sensitive building are arenas where massive energy savings can take place, with concomitant reduction in emissions and other ecological impacts. A shift away from chemical-based to organic, biologically diverse agriculture would have similar benefits. In the case of biodiversity, community-led approaches such as territories of life are proven time and again to be effective, and would help in averting biodiversity loss rather than have to go for offsets that are often ineffective, usually very expensive, and mostly resulting in the displacement or dispossession of communities.Net-zero and no-net-loss are ethically bankrupt, dangerous diversions in which the only beneficiaries are mega-corporations and governments. These worthies simply don’t want to take the meaningful actions that would tackle the climate crisis and biodiversity loss. For them, net-zero like approaches have become convenient fig-leaves to hide criminal negligence and inaction.This article first appeared on Wall Street International.

There’s a better way.by Benji JonesOn November 11, 2019, volunteers planted 11 million trees in Turkey as part of a government-backed initiative called Breath for the Future. In one northern city, the tree-planting campaign set the Guinness World Record for the most saplings planted in one hour in a single location: 303,150.“By planting millions of young trees, the nation is working to foster a new, lush green Turkey,” Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said when he kicked off the project in Ankara.Less than three months later, up to 90 percent of the saplings were dead, the Guardian reported. The trees were planted at the wrong time and there wasn’t enough rainfall to support the saplings, the head of the country’s agriculture and forestry trade union told the paper.In the past two decades, mass tree-planting campaigns like this one have gained popularity as a salve for many of our modern woes, from climate change to the extinction crisis. Companies and billionaires love these kinds of initiatives. So do politicians. Really, what’s not to like about trees? They suck up carbon emissions naturally while providing resources for wildlife and humans — and they’re even nice to look at. It sounds like a win-win-win.There’s just one problem: These campaigns often don’t work, and sometimes they can even fuel deforestation.Vox’s German Lopez is here to guide you through the Biden administration’s burst of policymaking. Sign up to receive our newsletter each Friday.In one recent study in the journal Nature, for example, researchers examined long-term restoration efforts in northern India, a country that has invested huge amounts of money into planting over the last 50 years. The authors found “no evidence” that planting offered substantial climate benefits or supported the livelihoods of local communities.The study is among the most comprehensive analyses of restoration projects to date, but it’s just one example in a litany of failed campaigns that call into question the value of big tree-planting initiatives. Often, the allure of bold targets obscures the challenges involved in seeing them through, and the underlying forces that destroy ecosystems in the first place.Instead of focusing on planting huge numbers of trees, experts told Vox, we should focus on growing trees for the long haul, protecting and restoring ecosystems beyond just forests, and empowering the local communities that are best positioned to care for them.In the past three decades, the number of tree-planting organizations has skyrocketed, growing nearly threefold in the tropics alone. So have global drives: Today, there are no fewer than three campaigns focused on planting 1 trillion trees, including the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) One Trillion Trees Initiative, which launched in 2020.It is hard to identify the exact moment when we became obsessed with planting trees. Some scientists point to the 2011 Bonn Challenge, which set an initial goal of restoring 150 million hectares of degraded and deforested land globally by 2020 and 350 million hectares by 2030. Others highlight a highly controversial study that appeared in Science in 2019 and inspired the WEF’s trillion tree campaign.The authors of the Science paper originally argued that restoring trees is “our most effective climate change solution to date” and said there’s “room” for 900 million hectares (2.2 billion acres) of new trees across the world. Almost 600 media outlets (including Vox) ran stories about the study in 2019, according to Carbon Brief.While many scientists criticized the paper, the idea behind it — that we can plant our way out of climate change, while simultaneously solving other problems like biodiversity loss — has stuck around. It’s a charming notion that’s much easier for companies or countries to act on, compared with doing the hard work of slashing greenhouse emissions.Tree-planting campaigns are typically well-intentioned, but they often fall short of delivering the benefits they promise, from capturing carbon to providing refuge for rare species. “Large-scale tree planting programs have high failure rates,” the authors of one paper, led by environmental researcher Forrest Fleischman, wrote in 2020.One of the most stunning examples of these failures comes from Fleischman’s research in northern India. If there’s a place where tree-planting projects might work, it’s in the state of Himachal Pradesh, said Fleischman, an associate professor at the University of Minnesota who led the recent Nature study. The state government has a strong track record of delivering services to the public, he said, and has been planting trees since at least 1980.An analysis of satellite imagery and interviews with hundreds of households, however, revealed that decades of planting by the government — amounting to hundreds of millions of seedlings — “had almost no impact on forest canopy cover,” Fleischman wrote on Twitter. The researchers also measured a shift in the type of trees within the ecosystem, away from species that locals prefer for firewood and animal fodder. In other words, residents of Himachal Pradesh actually had fewer useful forest resources.What went wrong? Some of the trees may have died quickly because they were planted in poor-quality habitat, Fleischman suspects. Farm animals could have also destroyed the saplings if they were planted in former grazing lands, he said. “Well-resourced forest restoration programs can fail to achieve their goals,” he added. “We need to be more skeptical of big claims.”In other parts of the world, tree-planting projects didn’t just fail, but also harmed existing ecosystems or ways of life.In Mexico, a $3.4 billion tree-planting campaign launched by the government in 2018 actually caused deforestation, as Bloomberg News’ Max de Haldevang reported earlier this year. The program known as Sembrando Vida, or Sowing Life, pays farmers to plant trees on their land, but in some cases, they would clear a chunk of forest before putting seedlings in the ground. One analysis by the World Resources Institute, an environmental group, suggests that it caused almost 73,000 hectares of forest loss in 2019.In Pakistan, researchers have linked a large, government-backed planting campaign that began in 2014 — known then as the Billion Tree Tsunami — to the erosion of culture and livelihoods of a nomadic group called the Gujjars. Traditionally, Gujjars rent winter pastures from landowners in parts of Pakistan to graze their animals. But through the tree-planting campaign, many of those landowners have replaced grazing land with tree plantations. “Many of the Gujjars have lost access to the private land on which they used to graze their animals in the winter,” Usman Ashraf, a researcher at the University of Helsinki, wrote in a 2018 paper.Researchers have also blamed large tree-planting efforts in China and Brazil for degrading grassland ecosystems. As I’ve previously reported, grasslands store vast amounts of carbon — most of which is below ground — and provide homes for countless species. Yet these ecosystems are sometimes considered degraded and are targeted for forest restoration campaigns.“We need to be looking at all of our ecosystems and not just put trees everywhere,” said Karen Holl, a professor of environmental studies and restoration expert at the University of California Santa Cruz.Solving a problem as vast as climate change or biodiversity loss is never as straightforward as planting lots of trees. People often think, “We’ll just plant trees and call that a restoration project, and we’ll exonerate our carbon sins,” said Robin Chazdon, a forest researcher at the University of the Sunshine Coast. Usually, she said, “that fails.”Buzzy tree-planting programs tend to obscure the fact that restoration requires a long-term commitment of resources and many years of monitoring. “We should just stop thinking about only tree-planting,” as climate scientist Lalisa Duguma has said. “It has to be tree-growing.” Even fast-growing trees take at least three years to mature, he added, while others can require eight years or more. “If our thinking of growing trees is downgraded to planting trees, we miss that big part of the investment that is required,” Duguma said.Holl, who has been involved in reviewing projects under the World Economic Forum’s trillion trees program, said she was “shocked” that many proposals called for two years or less of monitoring. “That’s not how long it takes for us to get the carbon or the biodiversity benefits that we want,” she said. (Companies with planting projects under the WEF program must report on progress each year for the duration of their projects, which the companies determine, a WEF spokesperson told Vox. Those reports typically include information on the projects’ social and ecological benefits, the spokesperson said.)“The people who need nature are going to vote for nature” —Forrest FleischmanA bigger problem still is that many large planting campaigns don’t account for the underlying social or economic conditions that fuel deforestation in the first place. People may cut down trees to collect firewood or carve out land for their animals. In those cases, putting seedlings in the ground won’t do much to end deforestation. “Planting trees might not be the intervention,” Fleischman said. “The intervention might be giving people a substitute for firewood.”This problem played out in Brazil after the 2019 fires in the Amazon rainforest. The group of powerful countries known as the G7 responded by offering to pay for restoration — but this offer didn’t address “the core issues of enforcing laws, protecting lands of indigenous people, and providing incentives to landowners to maintain forest cover,” Holl and her co-author wrote in a perspective in Science. The following year, Amazon fires and deforestation both surged. “The simplistic assumption that tree planting can immediately compensate for clearing intact forest is not uncommon,” they wrote.Ultimately, the only true global solution to restoring ecosystems is to support Indigenous and rural communities, Fleischman said. “Let’s look at places and think about how we can improve people’s lives,” he said. “The people who need nature are going to vote for nature.”To be clear, there are plenty of successful restoration programs — and they’re getting better, said Chazdon, who’s also an adviser for the WEF trillion trees campaign. “There is ample evidence that when restoration is done properly, it works,” she said.Consider the Pontal do Paranapanema, a region in southern Brazil home to vulnerable species like the rare black lion tamarin monkey. Over the last 35 years, a nonprofit called Instituto de Pesquisas Ecológicas has worked with local communities to plant some 2.7 million native trees, as Mongabay’s Liz Kimbrough reports. The trees provide useful products that locals want, such as fruit to eat and wood for building, and a new revenue stream from selling seedlings. At the same time, the new trees create a network of forest corridors that has helped populations of the tamarin recover. In this case, it really does seem to be a win-win-win.At the center of successful tree-planting campaigns like this are people, said Chazdon, who is compiling examples of effective restoration projects for a new mapping platform called Restor. As it happens, the platform is led by Thomas Crowther, an author of the controversial 2019 study in Science, which helped fuel the forest restoration frenzy.Even Crowther acknowledges that headlines stemming from the paper — namely, that we should plant a trillion trees — were too simplistic and even misleading. “We messed up the communications so badly,” Crowther told the Guardian earlier this month. “I hate that people keep asking me: where are you going to plant these trillion trees? I’ve never in my life said we should plant a trillion trees.” Crowther and his co-authors even revised the abstract of the Science paper to clarify their claim that tree restoration is “one of” the most effective solutions to fight climate change — not the most important one.Forests are, of course, good for the planet. And they do absorb loads of greenhouse gases, making them an important bulwark against rising temperatures. But headline-grabbing campaigns focused solely on planting trees can harm both people and ecosystems by focusing more on the goal itself than on the purpose behind it — and distracting us from the hard work of reducing emissions. The tough reality, as Holl puts it, is that “we’re not going to plant our way out of climate change.”CLIMATE / DOWN TO EARTHSep 22, 2021, 4:10 PM GMT+3is an environmental correspondent at Vox, covering biodiversity loss and climate change.

As it happens, the platform is led by Thomas Crowther, an author of the controversial 2019 study in Science, which helped fuel the forest restoration frenzy. Even Crowther acknowledges that headlines stemming from the paper — namely, that we should plant a trillion trees — were too simplistic and even misleading. “We messed up the communications so badly,” Crowther told the Guardian earlier this month. “I hate that people keep asking me: where are you going to plant these trillion trees? I’ve never in my life said we should plant a trillion trees.” Crowther and his co-authors even revised the abstract of the Science paper to clarify their claim that tree restoration is “one of” the most effective solutions to fight climate change — not the most important one. Forests are, of course, good for the planet. And they do absorb loads of greenhouse gases, making them an important bulwark against rising temperatures. But headline-grabbing campaigns focused solely on planting trees can harm both people and ecosystems by focusing more on the goal itself than on the purpose behind it — and distracting us from the hard work of reducing emissions. The tough reality, as Holl puts it, is that “we’re not going to plant our way out of climate change.” SEE MORE: CLIMATE DOWN TO EARTH SCIENCE"

It contains a bold commitment to “halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030 while delivering sustainable development and promoting an inclusive rural transformation.” Such a goal, it recognizes, is essential to meet the Paris Agreement to limit global average temperature increase to below 2 degrees and if possible, to 1.5 degrees.More specifically, these countries said they will strengthen efforts to conserve forests and other terrestrial ecosystems and enhance their restoration. They will facilitate trade, development and agricultural policies that will enable this, empower communities to become resilient and enhance rural livelihoods, and generate funds and align financial flows to support all these actions. They also committed to recognize the rights of Indigenous Peoples and other local communities as relevant to these goals and actions.The signatory countries contain 86% of the world’s forests, so if they are true to their commitment, global deforestation could well be halted or reduced to near zero by 2030 (though some countries with significant forest cover are missing, such as India, Malaysia, Uganda). But there lies the rub: how genuine is the commitment? Is this grandstanding on a global scale, noting that the world’s eyes are on Glasgow and some dramatic gestures have to be made? Or is it a genuine acknowledgement that urgent action is indeed needed for the survival of life on the planet?I would dearly like to believe it’s the latter; that a combination of intense public pressure, scientific opinion, and astute political sense has finally turned the tide in favour of the earth. But my usually optimistic self finds itself unable to take these 124 national leaders at their word. And this is not only because the likes of Brazilian President Bolsanaro, who has accelerated deforestation in the Amazon, are signatories. It is because of more structural reasons: reversing deforestation and land degradation requires challenging the very fundamentals of a global economy and governance that centralizes power in the hands of governments and capitalist corporations. It requires questioning and finding systemic alternatives to ‘development’ based on the ‘holy cow’ of economic growth. It means dismantling or defanging institutions like the World Trade Organisation, the World Bank and the IMF, and ‘free trade’ treaties, all much more powerful than multilateral environmental and human rights treaties. And it requires a dramatic shift of power to grassroots communities everywhere and the dismantling of patriarchal, racist and colonial relations. Somehow, I can’t see these 124 worthies even acknowledging the depth of transformations needed, let alone taking actions in these directions.If you think I’m being cynical, let’s look at recent history. In 2010, almost all countries of the world (the United States being a notable exception) agreed to the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020, under the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). The Plan contained the so-called Aichi Targets, to be met by 2020, which included conservation of terrestrial and marine ecosystems, species of flora and fauna, and other actions necessary to reverse the horrendous loss of biodiversity over the last few decades. In September 2020, the UN released a report, the Global Biodiversity Outlook 5, with the depressing conclusion that not a single Aichi Target had been fully met. The world had failed to achieve the following, Target 5: “By 2020, the rate of loss of all natural habitats, including forests, is at least halved and where feasible brought close to zero, and degradation and fragmentation is significantly reduced.” As the UN summed up: “Despite encouraging progress in several areas, the natural world is suffering badly and getting worse.”Note again that the Aichi Targets are part of the CBD. This is a legally binding instrument finalised in 1992. If targets under international law, with a much more universal commitment, have not been met, what are the chances that a non-legally binding commitment (which the Glasgow Declaration is) will be?The Declaration and related announcements have several seemingly positive elements. There is an acknowledgement that global trade, agricultural and financial flows that generate deforestation have to be changed. Over $20 billion have been committed by countries, donors and the private sector for relevant actions. 30 financial institutions with over $8.7 trillion of global assets have said they will use ""best efforts"" to eliminate investments in activities that lead to deforestation by agricultural commodity production, such as beef, soy, pulp & paper, and palm oil, by 2025.There will undoubtedly be some positive outcomes of these commitments, just like the Aichi Targets did lead to conservation action for some species and ecosystems. Some governments and companies will indeed move towards reducing their ecological footprint. But the Declaration itself has flaws that will nullify these benefits by allowing continued deforestation. The catch-all phrase “in accordance with relevant national legislation and international instruments, as appropriate” is similar to what is contained in CBD and other environmental instruments, neatly enabling countries and corporations to sidestep global commitments. The Declaration reiterates the goal of ‘resilient and inclusive growth’, despite increasing evidence that economic growth requiring continued extraction of materials, use of energy, and dumping of wastes, is simply unsustainable on a finite planet. And quite a bit of the finance is likely to head towards ‘net-zero’ kind of actions in which polluters continue to pollute and pay someone else to absorb the pollution, with all its well-known pitfalls, or to actions that could displace communities in the name of setting up protected areas or plantations disguised under nice-sounding terms like 'nature-based solutions'.Unless the enormous power of multinational corporations and national governments can be reined in, a future Global Biodiversity Outlook in 2030 is likely to conclude that the Glasgow Declaration has failed. For this people’s movements, particularly those of the youth that have emerged strongly in the last few years, and of Indigenous People, workers, farmers, fishers, pastoralists, need to join hands. We could use the Glasgow Declaration as a tool to expose companies and governments that do not stick by their commitments. We could push ourselves for more citizens’ action that regenerates and protects nature, such as Indigenous Peoples and local communities protecting Territories of Life, or the growing movement to recognize the rights of nature and hold governments accountable to their commitment to respect Indigenous and community rights. Most important, we have to claim power where we are, in villages and town neighbourhoods, and exercise it with responsibility towards other people and the rest of nature. Governments have repeatedly failed in delivering ecological and socio-economic justice, and there is no reason to believe they will suddenly change their spots.This article is also published in Wall Street International.

We will not stay below 2°C of warming while pursuing economic growth — yet barely anyone talks about it.Since the end of World War II, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth has been the metric of human prosperity in Western nations, the idea being that if the productivity of the economy increases so will the wellbeing of the people within that economy. And for a while, that was the case. But since the 1970s, increases in GDP have, on average, failed to translate into increases in wellbeing and happiness.It is not surprising. Research has shown that once a certain GDP threshold, or level of wellbeing, has been met people gain little from consuming more “stuff” — a necessary requirement for continuous GDP growth.Robert F Kennedy eloquently summed up the inadequacy of GDP as a metric of wellbeing at a speech he gave in 1968:What’s more, GDP has never been and can’t be decoupled from material footprint, including energy. This means we cannot roll out renewable energy fast enough to meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement – to keep warming below 2°C – if we continue growing our economy. Three percent growth every year for the rest of this decade is 30% growth by 2030.Achieving a 75% reduction on 2005 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030 is a Herculean effort already, let alone if the economy is 30% bigger by that time. And surely, given the urgency with which we must decarbonise, reducing energy demand must be a part of the mix, even if it means reducing GDP.There are nearly 8 billion people in the world today, but they haven’t all contributed equally to the climate crisis. Between 1990 and 2015, the world’s wealthiest 1% were responsible for double the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the poorest 50%. Over that same period, the wealthiest 10% of the world’s population were responsible for 52% of the world’s GHG emissions, while the poorest 50% were responsible for only 7% of the world’s GHG emissions.We are already breaching four [1] of the nine planetary boundaries, including biodiversity and climate change. On 29 July, we reached Earth Overshoot Day, which means that globally we have already consumed all of the ecological resources and services that can be regenerated in a year — for the remainder of the year, we will be taking from future generations. If the whole world lived like Australians and North Americans, we would need four planet Earths. This is not sustainable.But the real heart-starter is the power of exponential growth and how quickly it can consume resources. Three per cent growth each year means a doubling every 23 years. An economy that doubles 64 times – taking 1,472 years – will be 9,223,372,036,854,780,000 times larger than its original size. To help understand the magnitude of this number, consider that this is more than the estimated number of grains of sand on the planet. We will, at some point, accept that growth cannot go on forever. The sooner we do so, the less damage we will cause.Furthermore, exponential growth can really creep up on you. When we are utilising half of Earth’s capacity, we are only one doubling away from being at full capacity. If we are already breaching planetary boundaries, how can we handle another doubling and possibly another doubling after that? Either we implement planned degrowth – actively reducing the size of the economy in developed nations – or we risk collapse.Degrowing our economy to fit back within the planetary boundaries will also allow people living below satisfactory standards of human wellbeing to improve their living conditions. Data from 2016 showed that 940 million people still didn’t have access to electricity and 3 billion people didn’t have access to clean fuels for cooking. These people don’t even own a washing machine, let alone a car and they certainly aren’t flying anywhere. Degrowth is not only necessary to solve the climate crisis, it’s the only way to address widening inequality across the globe.What could life in a degrowth economy look like? It would involve shorter working weeks and less commuting, giving us more time to do things we enjoy. Less individual ownership and more sharing. Less debt and more services provided by the Government. A focus on community and connection rather than individualism and perpetually trying to find happiness through our next purchase, holiday or experience.In a degrowth economy, environmentally destructive and resource-intensive industries would be scaled back and more people would be working in jobs that benefited one another and the planet, putting more meaning and purpose into our lives. We would value different things in a degrowth economy and define success differently. A degrowth economy does not need to mean a degrowth lifestyle, indeed we could be richer for it.It’s probably tempting to define a degrowth economy as socialism, but it’s a false binary that an economic system is either capitalist or socialist. All economies are a mix of both, often with other bits of “isms” thrown in for good measure. Let’s use our imaginations and contemplate what life could look like if we focused on the things that really matter and not simply the amount of growth in our economy.The reasoning for degrowth is sound and the need to implement it urgent. But how do we get from this harmful system that is based on evermore resource extraction to this beautiful place where we will be living in harmony with nature and not against it? Where the wellbeing of people and planet is front and centre of decision making?This is where we come in. We need to shift the Overton window of politically safe topics to campaign on and ensure our representatives know that we want to have a habitable planet for our children. They need to know we cannot achieve that while blindly pursuing economic growth. It is us, the voters, who determine what our elected officials focus on. Each of us can write to our MPs and tell them that we want to actively degrow our economy to fit back within planetary boundaries by reducing sectors of the economy that add little to planetary and societal wellbeing, but significantly to climate change. If we are serious about tackling climate change, degrowth must be on the agenda.In the end, the economy is a man-made construct. It can be changed. The laws of nature, however, cannot. It would be tragic to look back and think we gave it all up because we weren’t brave enough to challenge the insane notion of endless growth on a finite planet with the urgency it deserves.This article is also published on Independent Australia.

To get the kind of cooperation we need, we must evaluate solutions based on their impacts across the globe and not just in terms of hitting the crucial milestones established during the Paris Agreement.There are realities that we cannot afford to ignore: while advanced economies are historically responsible for most of the emissions that have contributed to climate change, developing countries are the most affected by climate change. And the $100 billion that rich nations promised to channel to poorer nations annually to help them adapt to climate change has not been met.So if we try to battle climate change by shifting the costs to and stepping on the backs of developing countries, disadvantaged groups, and indigenous populations, we will have traded one catastrophe for another. Unfortunately, we have already slid in this direction. And avoiding the end result requires that developing countries not only advocate for themselves but also have someone on their side who understands their perspective and can meaningfully advocate for them on all fronts.In this article, I outline the challenge that the world community faces when it comes to implementing climate policies that are both effective and morally just and offer five steps for moving in the right direction.One overly simplistic answer to the question, “how did we get here?,” is colonialism. But the answer that gives us the best chance of moving forward is that recent discussions of climate change policy have been focused on all possible solutions (i.e., all possible decarbonization pathways and all governmental policies). Some COP26 commentators have even gone so far as saying that all response measure impacts are positive.However, while we have been focused on writing climate policy that is intended to save the world (a worthy endeavour for sure), we have lost sight of an important element of policies, namely that response measures to climate change have direct and indirect economic and social implications on the countries in which they are enacted.To add to that, we have also forgotten another important implication of response measures: even climate policies with positive economic and social implications on the countries in which they are enacted may have negative effects on other countries, including ones that are low emitters and that do not implement climate policies.For example, the carbon tax in Europe will have positive effects on Europe’s overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions but negative effects on agricultural imports from Africa. This is so because implementing carbon taxes would raise the price of imported agriculture. And because the agricultural industry is particularly high emitting, carbon taxes in the developed world can have a large negative effect on demand for agricultural imports and output, which in turn can harm agricultural employees in developing countries who may end up displaced from their jobs due to increasing prices for goods.Similarly, a carbon tax in Europe would raise the prices on African imports of European products, and consequently, the inflationary effects could harm production and employment in African nations. This effect can be alarmingly widespread across different sectors because, according to eurostat, approximately 70% of all goods exported from the EU to Africa in 2020 were manufactured goods and over 60% were primary goods (food, drinks, raw materials, and energy products). So such an increase could hurt manufacturing industries, economic diversification, and overall household incomes.Often, the effects on poorer households are more amplified, too! Economies in the world are connected through open trade, so a carbon tax in one jurisdiction affects both the nominal and real exchange rates, the prices of imports and exports, as well as industries and households that depend on them.To ensure that the cure is not worse than the disease when it comes to the impact of response measures on developing countries, we need to understand the effects of those measures on developing countries, so that we can design policies and just transition measures to ease any negative effects and maximize any positive ones.There are five steps we can take to ensure that developing countries are not forced to bear the brunt of both our warming world (for which advanced and large economies are most responsible) and the policy changes developed nations vote to enact.Now there are ways in which developing countries have a seat at the table. Because smaller and poorer countries have less of a voice on the international stage, they form coalitions to amplify their causes. For example, the Least Developed Countries group is a 46-nation bloc of countries most impacted by the climate crisis despite their low emissions, and includes Senegal, Bangladesh, and Yemen and represents one billion people. There is also the African Group of Negotiators on Climate Change and the Group of 77 and China. There groups were present and active at COP26.But for both successful climate policy and negotiations, it is important for developing countries to be empowered with information on the effects of external climate policy on their economies. Not only will this information help them to be empowered in the negotiations, but also such information will enable them to design policies to protect the wellbeing of their economies and citizens. To get here, it is important to have advocates who hear the plight of developing countries and can support them or assist them in these areas.When representatives of developing nations are better prepared to design just transition and other policies that can maximize the positive and minimize the negative effects of response measures, then they will have a true seat at the table.Once developing nations have a seat at the table, they need to regularly measure the impact of response measures on their economies. These data are not easy to capture because they require technical skills and models that detail impacts on countries as well as in-country impacts (households, industries, and others). To that end, assistance from technical groups, the UNFCCC, or even member states might be required.But the required framework already exist. In fact, UNFCCC has mandated that those implementing response measures provide technical support for developing countries to measure the impacts of response measures and also maximize the positives and minimize the negatives. So really, the only missing piece is the will of nations to make this happen.Still, signs of progress are popping up. I was part of a team that worked on a pilot project to come up with a modeling tool to assess the impacts of response measures on developing countries using case studies from Kenya and Senegal. The modeling tool and its results were presented and well received at COP26.In case you're worried that what I’m suggesting here would set back efforts to slow climate change, allow me to disabuse you of this concern here. Over the past few years, I have had the pleasure of working with the UNFCCC on awareness creation workshops (like this one), which I have presented in developing nations around the world.In these workshops, I explain how to build capacity through economic diversification as a response measure and what tools to measure, as well as how to measure the impacts, both positive and negative. I also present my own modeling work which examines the effects of response measures like fossil fuel subsidy removal as a measure for low carbon development and economic diversification, as well as the impact of other policy reforms, like increased competition, that can alleviate or even reverse the negative effects of reforming energy subsidies and expand economic diversification.My goal with my analyses in these workshops is to provide capacity building and to offer win-win policy reform solutions (as opposed to only asking developing countries to accept the effects of external policies that usually have winners and losers).Finally, it’s important for practitioners and relevant organizations to contribute to awareness-building and enhanced information-sharing through the exchange and sharing of experiences and best practices, etc.Through collaboration and input from stakeholders across the globe, we can start a trend of cooperation among nations. While it may be a stretch to get nations with wildly opposing interests to hold hands and sing a happy song, we could start by incentivizing an exchange of information that will foster empathy.12 years ago at the climate summit in Copenhagen, wealthy nations pledged to send US$100 billion per year to the developing world by 2020. This promise was broken.Although rich nations collectively agreed to finance the consequences of climate change on poorer nations as well as providing funds for transitioning their economies, they made no formal deal about how much each would pay. Instead, countries pledged in the hopes that others would follow their lead.Now we risk falling further behind financial benchmarks if wealthy nations do not figure out how to make good on their promise. One plan proposed by the V20, a group of finance ministers from 48 climate vulnerable countries, calls for $500 billion over the next five years and at least 50% of the funding to go to climate adaptation measures. This would be a good start. And meeting the $100 billion pledge annually is also a must.The urgency with which climate change reforms need to be undertaken cannot be overstated and yet, if we ignore the negative effects of these policies, we may save the world at the expense of social, economic, and climate justice. We should insist on implementing appropriate mitigation policies and just transition measures especially for women, youth, indigenous populations, minorities, and vulnerable groups (like refugees)!Contact the author at manal.shehabi@sheer-ra.com to learn more about response measures to climate change, economic diversification and its measurement using qualitative and quantitative tools, or the modeling tool and impacts of response measures and its impacts on Kenya.Energy Voices is a democratic space presenting the thoughts and opinions of leading Energy & Sustainability writers, their opinions do not necessarily represent those of illuminem.* The Report on the Modelling tool for ‘Assessing impacts of the implementation of response Measures’ can be found here:https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/RM_case_study_Senegal_Kenya.pdfThe report was led by Professor Scott McDonald (cgemod) for Dr. Kusum Lata (UNFCCC) and coauthored by him, Dr. Lindsay Shutes (cgemod), Professor Karen Theirfelder (US Naval Academy), and Dr. Manal Shehabi (Oxford Institute for Energy Studies and SHEER Research & Advisory).* The presentation on ‘Quantifying impacts of fossil fuel subsidy reform as response measure for low carbon development’ can be found here: https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/d2s6_2manal.pdfThis study was conducted by Dr. Manal Shehabi.* Information on the ‘Technical expert meeting on economic diversification’ in which Dr. Manal Shehabi participated is found here: https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Qualitative%20and%20quantitative%20tools.pdfThis meeting can be watched here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiBy2e-PsgE* The example on capacity building at a UNFCCC Awareness Creation workshops on ‘Economic Diversification and its Measurement Using Qualitative and Quantitative Tools’ can be found here:This work was conducted by Dr. Manal Shehabi.About the authorDr. Manal Shehabi is a Senior Research Fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies and Founding Director at SHEER Research & Advisory Ltd.Did you enjoy this illuminem voice?

Airbus has performed the first long-haul demonstration of formation flight in general air traffic (GAT) regulated transatlantic airspace with two A350 aircraft flying at three kilometres apart from Toulouse, France to Montreal, Canada. The aircraft were recently greeted at Montreal-Trudeau International Airport. Over six tonnes of CO2 emissions were saved on the trip, confirming the potential for more than a 5% fuel saving on long-haul flights. The “final demonstration” test flight took place on November 9 involving two A350 test aircraft – MSN1 and MSN59, the former as the leader aircraft and the latter as the follower. This was made possible with flight control systems developed by Airbus which position the follower aircraft safely in the wake updraft of the leader aircraft allowing it to reduce engine thrust and reduce fuel consumption. A similar principle can be observed with large migrating birds such as geese, which fly together in a distinct V-shaped formation. Airbus chief technical officer Sabine Klauke said, “This demonstration flight is a concrete example of our commitment to making our decarbonisation roadmap a reality. It also speaks to how collaboration across the industry will be key to making this happen. We have received a strong level of support for this project from our airline and air traffic partners, plus regulators. The opportunity to get this deployed for passenger aircraft around the middle of this decade is very promising. Imagine the potential if fello’fly was deployed across the industry!” Pilots from Airbus partner airlines – SAS Scandinavian Airlines and Frenchbee witnessed the transatlantic flight onboard as observers. The flight was made possible by Airbus and its air traffic management partners and navigation service providers (DSNA, NATS, NAV CANADA, Eurocontrol and IAA), with the support of the DGAC, who together proved that wake energy retrieval flight technology leveraged in a fello’fly flight can be achieved without compromising safety. The demonstration also shows how fello’fly operations could significantly boost environmental performance of commercial aircraft and contribute to the aviation industry’s decarbonisation targets in the immediate term. The next step is to get the support of the authorities so that this new operational concept can be certified, and ultimately enable airlines to reduce their fuel burn and CO2 emissions. The Airbus pioneering fello’fly flight was welcomed upon its arrival in Montreal by the Council President and Secretary General of the UN aviation agency, ICAO. Council President Salvatore Sciacchitano said the demonstration represented “ an inspiring example of the level of current commitment to reduce aviation emissions,” while ICAO Secretary-General Juan Carlos Salazar remarked on how it reflected “the incredible diversity of air transport innovations now being realised to meet the sector’s targets and ensure flying becomes more and more sustainable.” Launched in 2019, fello’fly is a flight demonstrator project hosted within Airbus UpNext using biomimicry (the design and production of materials, structures and systems inspired by nature). Airbus UpNext is a wholly-owned Airbus subsidiary and part of the Airbus innovation ecosystem, created to give future technologies a development fast-track by building demonstrators at speed and scale, in order to evaluate, mature and validate potential new products and services that encompass radical technological breakthroughs."

Evolving knowledge of climate sensitivity and polar ice melt-rate makes clear that sea-level rise is ramping, along with destructive storms, storm surges, severe precipitation and flooding, not forgetting wildfire. With mounting concern and recognition over the speed and pace of the low carbon energy transition that’s needed, nuclear has been reframed as a partial response to the threat of global heating. But at the heart of this are questions about whether nuclear could help with the climate crisis, whether nuclear is economically viable, what are the consequences of nuclear accidents, what to do with the waste, and whether there’s a place for nuclear within the swiftly expanding renewable energy evolution.As key experts who have worked on the front-line of the nuclear issue, we’ve all been involved at the highest governmental nuclear regulatory and radiation protection levels in the US, Germany, France and UK. In this context, we consider it our collective responsibility to comment on the main issue: Whether nuclear could play a significant role as a strategy against climate change.The central message, repeated again and again, that a new generation of nuclear will be clean, safe, smart and cheap, is fiction. The reality is nuclear is neither clean, safe or smart; but a very complex technology with the potential to cause significant harm. Nuclear isn’t cheap, but extremely costly. Perhaps most importantly nuclear is just not part of any feasible strategy that could counter climate change. To make a relevant contribution to global power generation, up to more than ten thousand new reactors would be required, depending on reactor design.In short, nuclear as a strategy against climate change is:This statement has been jointly issued by:Energy Voices is a democratic space presenting the thoughts and opinions of leading Energy & Sustainability writers, their opinions do not necessarily represent those of illuminem.About the authorDr Paul Dorfman is the fmr.

The group is very optimistic, as 77 per cent expect economic growth to improve over the coming year. They care about their people and are focused on trust, transparency and a higher sense of purpose. What they do not seem to consider is whether or not they will have a future.Just 22 per cent of leaders have made a net-zero commitment. Of those without such a target, more than half (57 per cent) do not think their company emits significant greenhouse gases. This strongly suggests that leaders in these companies — which are likely to be in the technology, consulting and insurance sectors, the research shows — do not understand how carbon impact is measured, and think they can focus on direct emissions only, ignoring the systemic impact their business makes.Further, more than half (55 per cent) of chief executives at companies without a net-zero commitment admit they do not have the capability to measure emissions. And with just 13 per cent having incentive plans linked to decarbonisation, the message is clear: climate change has little strategic impact.Such wilful blindness is startling but unsurprising. While many business leaders discuss their concerns about the climate, this survey suggests few know where or how to start. They cannot identify whose job this is, or how it fits into existing operations. Few are conversant with the categories — or scopes — of carbon emissions for which they will be held accountable.Many business leaders I talk to wish the government would be clearer and more directive. While it might be surprising to hear chief executives clamour for regulation, they believe it would level the playing field. Until then, they fear that seizing the initiative risks jeopardising competitiveness. Such leaders won’t act until compelled to, and governments are frequently wary of corporate pushback. This mutually assured stalemate is the opposite of leadership.In some companies where the climate emergency is discussed — or has even been formally declared — change is often visible but not strategic. For example, water fountains replace plastic water bottles and the canteen provides vegan options. A number of businesses now penalise expenditure on air travel where trains would be feasible. But for deeper, more strategic change, businesses must address different questions. What are the external costs of profits and how are those eliminated? Who and what gets hurt by a business’s decisions — and how does it address that before the damage is done? In a sustainable business, profit comes from solving problems — so how does a business solve more than it creates? What are the substitutions, redesigns, inventions that get carbon emissions to zero and then below?These may sound idealistic questions, but they are the questions that companies like Interface, Tata, Danone, Mastercard, Levi Strauss, Patagonia, Salesforce and Natura & Co confront as core to the business — not as afterthoughts. It is telling that many are consumer-facing businesses, forced to tackle the danger of losing legitimacy among customers.When Terry Smith calls out companies like Unilever for putting sustainability at the heart of its strategy, he helps those chief executives who would rather cling to the wreckage of environmental degradation than take the action required to build a positive future. Doing things in the familiar, old way is comforting; the new always feels risky. And it is easier to see the costs of strategic change because the costs of staying on the same course are not obvious. But that doesn’t mean they do not exist: the status quo trap is dangerous precisely because it is so comforting.All the chief executives I have met know about the climate crisis and think it is real. But when I have asked them where they see the risk of climate breakdown, few have considered the civil disruption which accompanies it: famine, migration, social and political breakdown. In a globalised world, such disruption is impossible to contain or escape. Companies depend on civil society: without it, they cannot function. In times of crisis, which we are in, one thing that keeps people, business and society going is social capital: a dense skein of relationships that create social cohesion. Its erosion is a critical danger in the next two years, according to the World Economic Forum. The environmental, social and democratic resilience we need won’t be conjured up the moment we want it; it will be years in the making. That requires leadership in its most literal sense: getting ahead.Optimistic, caring chief executives learnt a great deal about the importance of keeping people safe and healthy during the pandemic. They discovered, fast, just how important people are to their business resilience. But our response to climate change cannot wait for the worst to strike because even the fastest learning won’t be fast enough. We must get ahead of the problem in this decade, devising and executing detailed, scientific plans now, building resilience now. Creating, out of stasis, something real to be optimistic about.This article was first published in the Financial Times.

He published an essay on the hospitality industry about their practices to promote towel reuse.The term for ads and labels that promise more environmental benefit than they deliver is “greenwashing. It is a play on the term “whitewashing,” which means using misleading information to gloss over bad behavior.Greenwashing is not a recent phenomenon; since the mid-1980s the term has gained broad recognition and acceptance.It is “the intersection of two firm behaviors: poor environmental performance and positive communication about environmental performance”In 1999 the term was added to the Concise Oxford English Dictionary, which defines it as: “Disinformation disseminated by an organization so as to present an environmentally responsible public image; a public image of environmental responsibility promulgated by or for an organization, etc., but perceived as being unfounded or intentionally misleading”.TerraChoice defines greenwashing as “the act of misleading consumers regarding the environmental practices of a company or the environmental performance and positive communication about environmental performance”.Delmas and Burbano define it as “poor environmental performance and positive communication about environmental performance”.Baum considers greenwashing “the act of disseminating disinformation to consumers regarding the environmental practices of a company or the environmental benefits of a product or service”.Tateishi summarizes greenwashing as “communication that misleads people regarding environmental performance/benefits by disclosing negative information and disseminating positive information about an organization, service, or product”.Some scholars consider only environmental issues when talking about greenwashing, distinguishing it with the term bluewashing, which stands for social issues. Others researchers do not distinguish and consider greenwashing a social and environmental phenomenon.The accusation is a key element in the process, a charge or claim from a third party that someone has done something illegal or wrong. Without the accusation element, the definition of the phenomenon is incomplete.Now! I have a question for you….Have you ever bought any product with “All Natural or 100% organic” or maybe “Eco friendly ” written on it in possibly in the colour GREEN. Or at least you must have seen it.Probably the answer is YES.These labels are trying to convey something to you, something they are actually not, “GREEN”, good for the environment. Or environmentally friendly, etc.Many companies and giant corporations are using this strategy to build up a good and responsible image in your mind; the mind of consumers, stakeholders, and investors.If you were not aware of that and bought some products like these. Well in that case it worked!Which is good for their profit, but maybe not that good for you as a consumer or a human.The environmental revolution starting in the early 1990s has led to an increase in green marketing practices (TerraChoice, 2010). While green marketing can help consumers make better-informed product choices, it is also a strong marketing tool for companies to create product differentiation based on sustainability-related positioning.A1We will talk about it later……Studies have shown that people are happy to buy products that claim it is good for the environmentB1 B2, even though they get the same thing.The phenomena have arisen due to various factors one of them is the rise of public awareness about climate change and because organization around the globe knows that the public(you) are aware, and if you’re not you will be educated in some form or another.I am not saying it is a bad thing, but in this game of control and profit knowing what the other party knows can be a very useful thing.The guilt over climate change is increasing day by day and one of the big reasons, in my opinion, is the media, being used extensively by people in power like oil companies and government. And all the blame is being shifted towards the individuals who, although enjoyed the comfortable result of all these processes provided but were still unaware of it.Do you remember people telling you to switch to green options, track your “carbon footprint” C1 or turn off cars at the red light!It is your choice to do it or not, it depends on the condition you are in. But it is a valid example of governments and big corporations making you feel guilty over what they did and are doing while making you feel that small things are enough to bring a change, and if we try things will be normal again, which is not true.While …. Oil companies keep exploring and exploiting new sources of natural gas, coal, and crude oil (AKA Fossil fuels). F1 F2And while… Governments around the globe keep promising their citizens everything will improve without showing proper results. G1 G2 G3These results can be achieved by maybe decreasing future funds/subsidies from the fossil fuel industry and putting way money in research and development for maturing of technology we use to capture renewable energy, and hopefully preventing greenwashing in the sector too.But unfortunately, it won’t be that easy not subsiding this industry, especially in developing and underdeveloped countries, as it might just lead to more problems, like burning wood to cookD1 D2.June 23,1988 is the date when climate change and global warming became a national issue in American media and since then environment protection has also become a popular topic. H1 Consequently in public awareness, now stakeholders are more aware of environmental consideration, the past decade, stakeholders like investors, consumers, governments, and corporate customers are increasing the pressure on companies to disclose information about their environmental performance and for environmental-friendly products. H2Giving rise to a green marketSo obviously…… Companies start investing in green marketing communications, to be perceived as eco-friendly and socially engaged. Others who knew they will be scrutinized due to their net impact on the environment saw the benefit in similar activity hence they started promoting their “greenness” in advertisements.Which is a good move, on the part of that organization.In this day and age where everything we consume has an environmental footprint, from water to food, to energy, and thanks to the internet people are spreading awareness about things and can make others aware too. If you were in their shoes you better censor studies (which many did) I1 I2 and if possible counter information that may harm your business practices, hence greenwashing. I3 I4Green marketing vs greenwashingGreen marketing is different from greenwashing.In green marketing, the products are presumed to be environmentally safe, whereas greenwashing misleads consumers and even stakeholders about their environmental practices and their impact.Green skepticism has grown with greenwashing, and it would obstruct green marketing.The Nielsen Media Research presented that 66% of global consumers are willing to pay more for environmentally friendly products. When these customers perceive firms as socially responsible, they may be more willing to buy the products from these firms at a higher price. J1However and you may already know they are more than willing to lie to us about their environmental impact to sell more products, the reality behind corporate environmentalism can be disappointing.Advertising consultancy TerraChoice Environmental Marketing released a study to help customers identify greenwashing practices by companies with the seven sins of greenwashing K1 K2 ;The objective of the seven sins is to discourage companies to apply these green marketing strategies by giving the consumers information they need to be cautious in their purchase decisions.In actuality the phenomenon is harmful to all parties, it looks more like a temporary solution before they find a way out of the public scrutiny zone fix to there problem:The danger of greenwashing is if consumers get so skeptical that they don’t believe any green claims, then they lost an incredibly powerful tool. So we don’t want consumers to get too skeptical.Another problem would be then they also lost a tool that could have been used for good environmental improvements, this thing is bad, especially for governments across the globe and sooner or later they will need to improve the situation or they will face bigger problems than just people protesting.Unfortunately greenwashing is still legal because of a lack of effective regulation and in some cases conflict of interest:One good example is the cosmetic industry; today in the USA, within the cosmetics industry FDA does not define or regulate the term “organic” as it applies to cosmetics, body care, or personal care products.73 This lack of regulation allows cosmetic companies to advertise using terms like “bio-organic” for marketing to health-conscious consumers without any actual certification.Govt. vs Fossil fuel companyThroughout history, lobbying has been a common practice by the oil and gas industry. They use robust media and advertising budgets to fight and slow down the shift to clean energy. These greenwashing practices by the oil and gas industry have led to a history of government benefits from tax breaks to support against regulations. M4It won’t be wrong to say these oil giants learned a lot from Tabaco companies, who kept creating doubt about the relation between smoking and cancer. M5As a later document by tobacco company Brown and Williamson summarized the approach: “Doubt is our product since it is the best means of competing with the ‘body of fact’ that exists in the minds of the general public.”The overall goal by the oil and gas industry for this has been to renew support, increase investor confidence, and get more profit.Companies should present an environmental marketing claim in a way that makes clear whether the environmental attribute or benefit being asserted refers to the product, the product’s packaging, and a service or to a portion or component of the product. A comparative statement of the environmental marketing claims should be presented in a manner that makes the basis for the comparison sufficiently clear to avoid consumer deception. Companies should stop the frequent use of green color in the logos of different products. Green audit should be developed to evaluate the performance of the companies towards nature conservation. Environmental claims should be rated and greenwashing index should be measured. Government should look beneath the green veneer and hold corporations accountable by the media. Advertisement standards and corporate codes of conduct should be reformed.

Aim of this article: To give a picture of why a strategy like greenwashing is being used What is your role in all this? And how can you identify Greenwashing Let’s start with an obvious question, WHAT IS GREENWASHING? The term Greenwashing was coined (accused) first in 1986, by environmentalist Jay Westervelt. He published an essay on the hospitality industry about their practices to promote towel reuse. The term for ads and labels that promise more environmental benefit than they deliver is “greenwashing.

It is “the intersection of two firm behaviors: poor environmental performance and positive communication about environmental performance” In 1999 the term was added to the Concise Oxford English Dictionary, which defines it as: “Disinformation disseminated by an organization so as to present an environmentally responsible public image; a public image of environmental responsibility promulgated by or for an organization, etc., but perceived as being unfounded or intentionally misleading”. DEFINITION: TerraChoice defines greenwashing as “the act of misleading consumers regarding the environmental practices of a company or the environmental performance and positive communication about environmental performance”. Delmas and Burbano define it as “poor environmental performance and positive communication about environmental performance”. Baum considers greenwashing “the act of disseminating disinformation to consumers regarding the environmental practices of a company or the environmental benefits of a product or service”. Tateishi summarizes greenwashing as “communication that misleads people regarding environmental performance/benefits by disclosing negative information and disseminating positive information about an organization, service, or product”. Some scholars consider only environmental issues when talking about greenwashing, distinguishing it with the term bluewashing, which stands for social issues. Others researchers do not distinguish and consider greenwashing a social and environmental phenomenon. The accusation is a key element in the process, a charge or claim from a third party that someone has done something illegal or wrong. Without the accusation element, the definition of the phenomenon is incomplete. Now! I have a question for you…. Have you ever bought any product with “All Natural or 100% organic” or maybe “Eco friendly ” written on it in possibly in the colour GREEN. Or at least you must have seen it.

It also added new indicators and assessments focused on the just transition and climate accounting and audit to drive greater company ambition and reflect evolving investor priorities.The assessments indicate overall year-on-year improvements on cutting greenhouse gas emissions, improving climate governance, and strengthening climate-related financial disclosures. Driven by engagement from Climate Action 100+ investor signatories, the results specifically show that:However, it is alarming that the vast majority of companies have not set medium-term emissions reduction targets aligned with 1.5°C or fully aligned their future capital expenditures with the goals of the Paris Agreement, despite the increase in net zero commitments.Specifically, the assessments reveal:These results are disappointing as they are focused on areas which demonstrate tangible translation of commitments into action, indicating what companies are going to do over the short term to achieve their longer-term goals. They also come amongst broader evidence that the world is failing to step up to the meet the challenges of the growing climate crisis.In a newly released report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that the window of opportunity to take any meaningful climate action is rapidly closing and worldwide emissions must fall by 45% by 2030 to have any chance at keeping global temperature rise under 1.5°C.Climate Action 100+, which now includes 700 signatories responsible for USD 68 trillion in assets under management, is calling on all focus companies to step up climate ambition before a third round of Benchmark assessments is released later this year.Investors are also expected to escalate pressure on companies and boards during the upcoming proxy season in the U.S. and Europe, following last year’s record high majority votes on climate proposals. The next several months will be a critical time for investors to support key climate shareholder resolutions, including those flagged by the initiative, that are aligned with the goals of the initiative and the Paris Agreement.The Benchmark is clearly driving an increase in corporate disclosures from focus companies. TPI, which assessed companies against the Disclosure Framework with support from its data partner FTSE Russell, received a record number of responses from companies during the review period in December 2021[2] , signalling clear interest from companies to engage with the Benchmark. It also provided focus companies with a standardised way of reporting on corporate climate ambition, with the framework being increasingly used to frame net zero transition planning in company annual reports.Sector and issue specific analyses from the Alignment Assessments, which complement the Disclosure Framework, finds that:Members of the Climate Action 100+ global Steering Committee join investor calls for stepped up climate ambition and action:Stephanie Maier, Global Head of Sustainable and Impact Investment at GAM Investments and current chair of the global Climate Action 100+ Steering Committee: “Overall the Net Zero Company Benchmark clearly shows that focus companies are not making the progress required to align with achieving the 1.5°C climate goal agreed in Paris and reaffirmed in Glasgow last year. Given that these companies represent the world’s largest corporate greenhouse gas emitters, their ambition and pace of change is critical to a successful transition and needs to accelerate. The latest IPCC report starkly outlined the social and economic imperative for this. As a consequence, we should expect a ratcheting of investor-led shareholder resolutions as well as increased scrutiny on transition plans brought to the vote, starting with the imminent AGM season.”Stephanie Pfeifer, IIGCC CEO and current vice-chair of the global Climate Action 100+ Steering Committee: “The Climate Action 100+ initiative has shown that investors can influence companies through meaningful engagement and good stewardship. However, while there has been a level of progress by focus companies towards net zero by 2050 with the majority setting long-term targets, many remain far from where they need to be if they are to help limit a global temperature rise to 1.5°C. Investors are calling on focus companies to credibly set out details of their net zero transition plans and will step up their engagements to ensure companies move from target setting to delivery.”Simiso Nzima, Managing Investment Director of Global Equity at CalPERS and a member of the global Steering Committee: “We will continue to use the power of collaborative engagements and proxy voting to drive action at our portfolio companies to align their climate ambitions with their long-term strategies and capital allocation decisions. As a long-term investor, we want our portfolio companies to execute sustainable business models and thrive in a low carbon economy.”Mindy Lubber, Ceres CEO and President and a member of the global Steering Committee: “While we welcome the new climate commitments from North American focus companies, companies are still not where they need to be to help stabilize the climate and mitigate the worst impacts of this growing crisis. Companies must ratchet up their climate ambition and action, and as we head into this year’s U.S. proxy season, investors will continue to use the results of the Climate Action 100+ Net Zero Company Benchmark to strengthen their own engagement and voting strategies. There is too much at stake. All eyes will be on companies and their investors as they work to respond to the results at the necessary speed and scale required.”Seiji Kawazoe, Senior Stewardship Officer at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management and a member of the global Steering Committee: “Asian companies have made encouraging progress on climate, but investors will expect many to publish clear and robust plans to reach net zero and assess their progress against their peers through the Climate Action 100+ Net Zero Company Benchmark. Company commitments will be expected to be more ambitious than the Nationally Determined Contributions in their markets where they are based and where proven effective the deployment of decarbonisation technologies to achieve climate goals”.Rebecca Mikula-Wright, CEO of AIGCC and IGCC and a member of the global Steering Committee: “Companies across Australia and Asia must respond to the very clear call from investors to accelerate their decarbonisation plans. The Climate Action 100+ Benchmark is a necessary and valuable tool for companies to understand investor expectations. It guides transparency around credible net zero emissions strategies. As part-owners, investors have a common goal to achieve short, medium and long term sustainable returns but they also need to see companies both managing and adapting to the increasing climate risks and also being successful in the transition by seizing opportunities. Net zero goals are the minimum expectation, and now investors need to see companies making faster progress executing their decarbonisation plans.”Andrew Gray, Director, ESG and Stewardship at AustralianSuper and a member of the global Steering Committee: “We know that the current climate trajectory presents a systemic risk to investment portfolios and long-term returns to funds’ beneficiaries. This demands intensified engagement from investors, calling for near-term action from the companies they are invested in. Long-term engagement works and accountability is key.”David Atkin, CEO of PRI and a member of the global Steering Committee: “It’s very encouraging to see the great progress achieved by Climate Action 100+ and its signatories. This Benchmark clearly shows meaningful progress on important areas with 69% of focus companies having now committed to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner. However, it’s increasingly clear that we need to see more action, taken further and faster, to stand a realistic chance of keeping a 1.5˚C future alive. That means we need to see companies make ambitious, near-term targets, and that we need investors to continue to push for improved transparency and accountability through their stewardship programmes.”Research and data organisations involved in the Benchmark provided comments:Valentin Jahn, TPI Lead Research Analyst and TPI Climate Action 100+ Project Lead: “Although companies are not yet doing enough to limit global mean temperature rise to 1.5°C or even 2°C, the Climate Action 100+ Benchmark is a powerful asset in the climate mitigation toolbox. The long-term direction is clear as shown by the increase in 2050 net zero targets. However, this consensus is not yet tied to concrete action. Decarbonisation strategies should quantify the contribution of measures towards the company’s emission targets and companies should state their commitment to align their capital expenditure with their emission reduction goals together with a methodology detailing how such alignment is assessed. The Climate Action 100+ Benchmark framework is well placed to incentivise and measure progress on these crucial issues, backing up ambitions with concrete plans.”Barbara Davidson, Head of Accounting, Audit, and Disclosure at Carbon Tracker Initiative: “Investors must urgently understand the level of capital at risk from continued use of fossil fuels, in order to work with companies to transition as quickly as possible. The Climate Accounting and Audit Alignment Assessment identifies the need for better transparency regarding impacts of the energy transition on companies’ financial positions and operations. It highlights inconsistencies across companies’ climate narratives, supporting investors in their assessment of corporate governance, allocation of capital, and investee engagement.”David Pitt-Watson, Leader, Climate Accounting Project: “The acid test of whether a company is taking climate into account is revealed in the way it draws up its financial statements. For all Climate Action 100+ focus companies, climate is a material issue. Hence, in drawing up their accounts, climate risks must be considered and assumptions shown. Climate Action 100+ investors have demanded those assumptions are sustainable ones. But this is not yet happening. It needs to, since we won’t address global warming if in calculating profits, companies and their auditors simply turn a blind eye to the climate challenge”.Maarten Vleeschhouwer, Head of PACTA at 2° Investing Initiative: “2° Investing Initiative is proud to contribute to Climate Action 100+’s work as a provider of alignment assessment indicators and member of the Technical Advisory Group. Using the PACTA methodology and Asset Resolution data, our analysis shows almost all focus list companies in the steel, cement and aviation sectors are significantly behind IEA net zero pathways. Additionally, while power and automotive focus list companies are starting to decrease production of coal power and ICE vehicles, planned investment in renewables and electric vehicles is nowhere near enough to be on a pathway to net zero. Critically, investors must also ensure that focus list companies are closing down coal power capacity, not just selling it off.”Joe Brooks, Climate Action 100+ Investor Engagement Lead and Senior Analyst at InfluenceMap: “The science shows that robust government climate policy is a prerequisite for delivering net-zero emissions. Investors are increasingly clear they expect companies to support the passage of such measures, rather than block them. However, Climate Action 100+ companies are falling far short of these expectations. The majority of focus companies continue to obstruct or undermine ambitious climate policy, either directly or via memberships to industry associations acting on their behalf. Investors are in a unique position to be able to push focus companies towards implementing robust and transparent audit processes, to drive closer alignment between corporate climate policy engagement and the 1.5°C goal of the Paris Agreement.”Climate Action 100+ will give focus companies another opportunity to step up and demonstrate progress with a further round of assessments to be released later this year. Companies will be given the opportunity to provide additional disclosures or commitments, announced between 1st January 2022 and 13th May, to improve their Benchmark results[4].Climate Action 100+, which is in its final year of phase 1, will continue with more ambitious goals as demanded by the urgency of the growing climate crisis.The Climate Action 100+ Net Zero Company Benchmark aims to define the key elements of a robust ‘net zero aligned’ business strategy, to give investors’ confidence that companies are developing comprehensive net zero transition plans.To reflect the pace of change required and to ensure it is aligned with the most recent science-based policy, the Benchmark methodology underwent a limited number of enhancements for the March 2022 company assessments. These include:For a deeper dive into the results, watch the webinars we ran following the launch of the March 2022 Benchmark assessments. Click here to access the US/Europe focused webinar recording and click here to watch the Asia-Pacific focused webinar recording (Zoom password: 68ASuKa%).Climate Action 100+ is the world’s largest investor engagement initiative on climate change. It involves 700 investors, responsible for over $68 trillion in assets under management. Investors are focused on ensuring 166 of the world’s biggest corporate greenhouse gas (GHG) emitters take the necessary actions to align their business strategies with the goals of the Paris Agreement. This includes improving corporate governance of climate change, reducing GHG emissions, and strengthening climate-related financial disclosures.The 166 focus companies include the initial 100 ‘systemically important emitters’, identified with the highest combined direct and indirect GHG emissions, and additional companies selected by investors as critical to accelerating the net zero transition.Launched in 2017, Climate Action 100+ is coordinated by five investor networks: Asia Investor Group on Climate Change (AIGCC); Ceres (Ceres); Investor Group on Climate Change (IGCC); Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) and Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). These organisations, along with investor representatives from AustralianSuper, California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS), Gam Investments, and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management form the global Steering Committee for the initiative. Follow us on Twitter: @ActOnClimate100.[1] This is a provisional assessment. The data is based on 2020 company accounts (released in 2021). Global accounting and auditing standard-setters, such as IASB and IAASB, have clarified that material climate-related risks should not be ignored in accounts or in audits.[2] During the review period in December 2021, focus companies were invited to review their preliminary assessments and flag any inaccuracies or missed disclosures.[3] International Energy Agency Net Zero by 2050 Roadmap for the Global Energy Sector, May 2021: https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050[4] The review period, during which companies can provide additional disclosures or commitments, will be open from 12th April to 13th May.[5] As the initiative is still developing appropriate methodology on just transition, this indicator will appear in ‘beta’ form for the March 2022 Benchmark, meaning that data will be collected internally to inform the indicator’s future development, but focus companies will not be publicly scored against it. Similarly, the climate accounting and audit assessment will take the form of a ‘provisional’ indicator, meaning that companies will be publicly assessed against it in March 2022 but the framework will be subject to change in future iterations of the Benchmark.While 69% of focus companies have set commitments to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner, overall Benchmark finds companies have failed to show progress across key indicators, including disclosure of 1.5°C-aligned medium-term emissions targets and capex strategies.Benchmark sets urgent engagement priorities for USD 68 trillion investor-led initiative ahead of U.S. and European proxy season and as it marks the final year of its first phase.Investor signatories will give focus companies another chance to step up action in 2022, with another round of assessments planned for later in the year.69% of focus companies have now committed to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner across all or some of their emissions footprint, a 17% year-on-year increase90% of focus companies have some level of board oversight of climate change89% of focus companies have aligned with TCFD recommendations either by supporting the TCFD principles or by employing climate-scenario planning.CTI also finds that almosttwo thirds of oil and gas focus companies are still sanctioning projects inconsistent with limiting global warming to less than 2°C. The IEA’s Net Zero by 2050 roadmap made it clear that there can be no new oil and gas exploration and production if we are going to keep 1.5°C within reach.There is a considerable gap between what companies are saying publicly on climate lobbying and doing in practice. 54% of focus companies have mixed direct engagement with Paris-aligned climate policy, according to InfluenceMap data. However, only 9% have broad alignment between their direct climate policy engagement activities and the Paris Agreement. Also concerning is that only 2% of focus companies are aligned with the Paris Agreement in their indirect climate policy engagement activities via their industry associations.Almost no steel, cement, or aviation focus companies’ emissions intensities are aligned with limiting global warming to less than 2°C, 2° Investing Initiative (2DII) finds. Most utility companies are not adding renewables and other low-carbon technologies fast enough to limit global warming to 1.5°C. Similarly, most auto companies are not phasing out internal combustion engine vehicles and adding enough electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles fast enough to limit global warming to 1.5°C.Companies have been assessed against the IEA’s more challenging Net Zero by 2050 scenario for available sectors to reflect the level of ambition required to limit global warming to 1.5°C. This applies to Disclosure Framework metrics 2.2, 3.3, and 4.3. In March 2021, most focus companies were assessed against the IEA’s Beyond 2° Scenario, a less stringent scenario. The initiative recognises this may have made improving scores on some indicators more challenging for focus companies.Additional Alignment Assessments, formerly known as ‘Capital Allocation Indicators’. These include InfluenceMap’s ‘Organisation Scores’ and ‘Relationship Scores’, which assess focus companies’ direct and indirect climate policy engagement activities respectively. In addition, they include new analytics from 2 Degrees Investing Initiative measuring the emissions intensities of steel, cement, and aviation companies against reference climate scenarios.Continued absence of Scope 3 emissions.Alignment of capex strategies with net zero transition goals remains almost non-existent.While 69% of focus companies have set commitments to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner, overall Benchmark finds companies have failed to show progress across key indicators, including disclosure of 1.5°C-aligned medium-term emissions targets and capex strategies. Benchmark sets urgent engagement priorities for USD 68 trillion investor-led initiative ahead of U.S. and European proxy season and as it marks the final year of its first phase. Investor signatories will give focus companies another chance to step up action in 2022, with another round of assessments planned for later in the year. New assessments released today by Climate Action 100+, the world’s largest investor engagement initiative on climate change, show some corporate climate progress against key climate indicators, but find much more action is urgently needed from focus companies to support global efforts to limit temperature rise to 1.5°C. This is the second round of Net Zero Company Benchmark assessments to be released by Climate Action 100+ since March 2021. 166 companies on the initiative’s focus list were measured on their progress against the initiative’s three engagement goals and a set of key indicators related to business alignment with the goals of the Paris Agreement.

However, it is alarming that the vast majority of companies have not set medium-term emissions reduction targets aligned with 1.5°C or fully aligned their future capital expenditures with the goals of the Paris Agreement, despite the increase in net zero commitments. Specifically, the assessments reveal: An absence of medium-term emissions reductions targets aligned with 1.5°C. Only 17% of focus companies have set medium-term targets which are aligned with the IEA’s 1.5°C scenario and cover all material emissions. Continued absence of Scope 3 emissions. Just 42% of focus companies have comprehensive net zero by 2050 or sooner commitments that cover all material GHG emissions, including material Scope 3 emissions. Alignment of capex strategies with net zero transition goals remains almost non-existent. Only 5% of focus companies explicitly commit to align their capex plans with their long-term GHG reduction targets. Companies are setting emissions reduction targets but don’t have the strategies to deliver them. Only 17% of focus companies have robust quantified decarbonisation strategies in place to reduce their GHG emissions. A failure to integrate climate risk into accounting and audit practices. No company has demonstrated that its financial statements are drawn up using assumptions consistent with net zero by 2050, as per a new indicator on climate accounting and audit assessed by CTI and CAP.[1] This Benchmark indicator has been introduced into Climate Action 100+ for the first time this year. These results are disappointing as they are focused on areas which demonstrate tangible translation of commitments into action, indicating what companies are going to do over the short term to achieve their longer-term goals. They also come amongst broader evidence that the world is failing to step up to the meet the challenges of the growing climate crisis. In a newly released report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that the window of opportunity to take any meaningful climate action is rapidly closing and worldwide emissions must fall by 45% by 2030 to have any chance at keeping global temperature rise under 1.5°C. Climate Action 100+, which now includes 700 signatories responsible for USD 68 trillion in assets under management, is calling on all focus companies to step up climate ambition before a third round of Benchmark assessments is released later this year.

It also provided focus companies with a standardised way of reporting on corporate climate ambition, with the framework being increasingly used to frame net zero transition planning in company annual reports. Sector and issue specific analyses from the Alignment Assessments, which complement the Disclosure Framework, finds that: Less than one third of electric utility focus companies have a coal phaseout plan consistent with limiting global warming to less than 2°C, according to data from Carbon Tracker Initiative (CTI). This is concerning as the IEA’s Net Zero by 2050 roadmap, published in May 2021, says that in order to keep 1.5°C alive, coal-fired power must be phased out in advanced economies by 2030, and globally by 2040. [3] CTI also finds that almosttwo thirds of oil and gas focus companies are still sanctioning projects inconsistent with limiting global warming to less than 2°C. The IEA’s Net Zero by 2050 roadmap made it clear that there can be no new oil and gas exploration and production if we are going to keep 1.5°C within reach.

However, it’s increasingly clear that we need to see more action, taken further and faster, to stand a realistic chance of keeping a 1.5˚C future alive. That means we need to see companies make ambitious, near-term targets, and that we need investors to continue to push for improved transparency and accountability through their stewardship programmes.” Research and data organisations involved in the Benchmark provided comments: Valentin Jahn, TPI Lead Research Analyst and TPI Climate Action 100+ Project Lead: “Although companies are not yet doing enough to limit global mean temperature rise to 1.5°C or even 2°C, the Climate Action 100+ Benchmark is a powerful asset in the climate mitigation toolbox. The long-term direction is clear as shown by the increase in 2050 net zero targets. However, this consensus is not yet tied to concrete action. Decarbonisation strategies should quantify the contribution of measures towards the company’s emission targets and companies should state their commitment to align their capital expenditure with their emission reduction goals together with a methodology detailing how such alignment is assessed. The Climate Action 100+ Benchmark framework is well placed to incentivise and measure progress on these crucial issues, backing up ambitions with concrete plans.” Barbara Davidson, Head of Accounting, Audit, and Disclosure at Carbon Tracker Initiative: “Investors must urgently understand the level of capital at risk from continued use of fossil fuels, in order to work with companies to transition as quickly as possible. The Climate Accounting and Audit Alignment Assessment identifies the need for better transparency regarding impacts of the energy transition on companies’ financial positions and operations. It highlights inconsistencies across companies’ climate narratives, supporting investors in their assessment of corporate governance, allocation of capital, and investee engagement.” David Pitt-Watson, Leader, Climate Accounting Project: “The acid test of whether a company is taking climate into account is revealed in the way it draws up its financial statements. For all Climate Action 100+ focus companies, climate is a material issue. Hence, in drawing up their accounts, climate risks must be considered and assumptions shown. Climate Action 100+ investors have demanded those assumptions are sustainable ones. But this is not yet happening. It needs to, since we won’t address global warming if in calculating profits, companies and their auditors simply turn a blind eye to the climate challenge”. Maarten Vleeschhouwer, Head of PACTA at 2° Investing Initiative: “2° Investing Initiative is proud to contribute to Climate Action 100+’s work as a provider of alignment assessment indicators and member of the Technical Advisory Group. Using the PACTA methodology and Asset Resolution data, our analysis shows almost all focus list companies in the steel, cement and aviation sectors are significantly behind IEA net zero pathways. Additionally, while power and automotive focus list companies are starting to decrease production of coal power and ICE vehicles, planned investment in renewables and electric vehicles is nowhere near enough to be on a pathway to net zero. Critically, investors must also ensure that focus list companies are closing down coal power capacity, not just selling it off.” Joe Brooks, Climate Action 100+ Investor Engagement Lead and Senior Analyst at InfluenceMap: “The science shows that robust government climate policy is a prerequisite for delivering net-zero emissions. Investors are increasingly clear they expect companies to support the passage of such measures, rather than block them. However, Climate Action 100+ companies are falling far short of these expectations. The majority of focus companies continue to obstruct or undermine ambitious climate policy, either directly or via memberships to industry associations acting on their behalf. Investors are in a unique position to be able to push focus companies towards implementing robust and transparent audit processes, to drive closer alignment between corporate climate policy engagement and the 1.5°C goal of the Paris Agreement.” Climate Action 100+ will give focus companies another opportunity to step up and demonstrate progress with a further round of assessments to be released later this year. Companies will be given the opportunity to provide additional disclosures or commitments, announced between 1st January 2022 and 13th May, to improve their Benchmark results[4]. Climate Action 100+, which is in its final year of phase 1, will continue with more ambitious goals as demanded by the urgency of the growing climate crisis. ABOUT THE BENCHMARK METHODOLOGY The Climate Action 100+ Net Zero Company Benchmark aims to define the key elements of a robust ‘net zero aligned’ business strategy, to give investors’ confidence that companies are developing comprehensive net zero transition plans. To reflect the pace of change required and to ensure it is aligned with the most recent science-based policy, the Benchmark methodology underwent a limited number of enhancements for the March 2022 company assessments. These include: Companies have been assessed against the IEA’s more challenging Net Zero by 2050 scenario for available sectors to reflect the level of ambition required to limit global warming to 1.5°C. This applies to Disclosure Framework metrics 2.2, 3.3, and 4.3. In March 2021, most focus companies were assessed against the IEA’s Beyond 2° Scenario, a less stringent scenario. The initiative recognises this may have made improving scores on some indicators more challenging for focus companies. New indicators and assessments aim to drive greater company ambition on the just transition and climate accounting and audit, and reflect evolving investor priorities.[5] Additional Alignment Assessments, formerly known as ‘Capital Allocation Indicators’. These include InfluenceMap’s ‘Organisation Scores’ and ‘Relationship Scores’, which assess focus companies’ direct and indirect climate policy engagement activities respectively. In addition, they include new analytics from 2 Degrees Investing Initiative measuring the emissions intensities of steel, cement, and aviation companies against reference climate scenarios.

ABOUT CLIMATE ACTION 100+ Climate Action 100+ is the world’s largest investor engagement initiative on climate change. It involves 700 investors, responsible for over $68 trillion in assets under management. Investors are focused on ensuring 166 of the world’s biggest corporate greenhouse gas (GHG) emitters take the necessary actions to align their business strategies with the goals of the Paris Agreement. This includes improving corporate governance of climate change, reducing GHG emissions, and strengthening climate-related financial disclosures. The 166 focus companies include the initial 100 ‘systemically important emitters’, identified with the highest combined direct and indirect GHG emissions, and additional companies selected by investors as critical to accelerating the net zero transition. Launched in 2017, Climate Action 100+ is coordinated by five investor networks: Asia Investor Group on Climate Change (AIGCC); Ceres (Ceres); Investor Group on Climate Change (IGCC); Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) and Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). These organisations, along with investor representatives from AustralianSuper, California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS), Gam Investments, and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management form the global Steering Committee for the initiative. Follow us on Twitter: @ActOnClimate100. NOTES TO EDITORS [1] This is a provisional assessment. The data is based on 2020 company accounts (released in 2021). Global accounting and auditing standard-setters, such as IASB and IAASB, have clarified that material climate-related risks should not be ignored in accounts or in audits. [2] During the review period in December 2021, focus companies were invited to review their preliminary assessments and flag any inaccuracies or missed disclosures. [3] International Energy Agency Net Zero by 2050 Roadmap for the Global Energy Sector, May 2021: https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050 [4] The review period, during which companies can provide additional disclosures or commitments, will be open from 12th April to 13th May. [5] As the initiative is still developing appropriate methodology on just transition, this indicator will appear in ‘beta’ form for the March 2022 Benchmark, meaning that data will be collected internally to inform the indicator’s future development, but focus companies will not be publicly scored against it. Similarly, the climate accounting and audit assessment will take the form of a ‘provisional’ indicator, meaning that companies will be publicly assessed against it in March 2022 but the framework will be subject to change in future iterations of the Benchmark."

For example, MIT Technology Review and ProPublica uncovered how The Massachusetts Audubon Society received carbon credits for conserving forests that were never in danger of being cut down; and when companies like Shell, Phillips 66, and the Southern California Gas Company bought these credits as part of their carbon offset programme, they failed to offset their emissions due to this crucial factor.Though carbon offsetting can be beneficial, its susceptibility to varying degrees of greenwashing negates its impact.

Its carbon dioxide emissions grew an eye-popping 18 percent in 2021 compared to 2020, according to its latest sustainability report.Amazon generated 71.54 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent last year, about as much pollution as 180 gas-fired power plants might pump out annually. This is the second year in a row that Amazon’s climate pollution has grown by double digits since it made a splashy climate pledge and started reporting its emissions publicly in 2019. Comparing that year to 2021, the company’s CO2 pollution has actually grown a whopping 40 percent.Back in 2019, then-CEO Jeff Bezos announced that the company planned to reach net-zero carbon dioxide emissions for its operations by 2040. Unfortunately, that kind of pledge allows companies to get away with some misleading carbon accounting. They can aim to reach “net-zero” emissions or claim to be “carbon-neutral” by purchasing carbon offsets that are supposed to cancel out the impact of their emissions through supposedly eco-friendly projects. That usually involves planting trees, protecting forests, or promoting clean energy. Those offsets, however, typically don’t result in real-world reductions in the planet-heating CO2 building up in our atmosphere.Amazon co-founded an initiative called the “Climate Pledge” in 2019 to recruit other businesses to make similar commitments to reduce CO2 and “neutralize” leftover emissions with “credible” offsets. But a meaningful impact on the climate only comes from a company getting rid of the vast majority of its pollution, if not eliminating all of its emissions.Amazon isn’t setting a good example of that — despite the company’s best PR efforts. To take the heat off its growing absolute carbon emissions, Amazon points to a more flattering number in its sustainability report. “The focus should not be solely on a company’s carbon footprint in terms of absolute carbon emissions, but also on whether it’s lowering its carbon intensity,” the report says.Amazon says it reduced its “carbon intensity” by a small figure — 1.9 percent — meaning the emissions they produce for every dollar of merchandise sold fell slightly. But this metric can also be misleading because those reductions in carbon intensity are easily wiped out when the company’s business grows.That’s exactly what’s happened at Amazon. “As we work to decarbonize our company, Amazon is growing rapidly. We have scaled our business at an unprecedented pace to help meet the needs of our customers through the pandemic,” the company says in its sustainability report.

75,http://www.recyclingtoday.com/article/ftc-green-guides-updates-comment-request-apr-response,znka3n,FTC seeks comments on potential updates to its Green Guides - Recycling Today,"Dec. 15, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced that it is seeking public comment on potential updates and changes to the Guides for the Use of Environmental Claims, also known as the Green Guides. The Commission’s Green Guides are designed to help marketers avoid making environmental marketing claims that are unfair or deceptive under Section 5 of the FTC Act. The commission says it wants to update the guides based on increasing consumer interest in buying environmentally friendly products.The Association of Plastic Recyclers (APR), Washington, says it intend to submit comments and to participate in the updating process.“Consumers are increasingly conscious of how the products they buy affect the environment and depend on marketers’ environmental claims to be truthful,” Bureau of Consumer Protection Director Samuel Levine says. “We look forward to this review process and will make any updates necessary to ensure the Green Guides provide current, accurate information about consumer perception of environmental benefit claims. This will both help marketers make truthful claims and consumers find the products they seek.”The FTC first issued the Green Guides in 1992, with revisions issued in 1996, 1998 and 2012. They provide guidance on environmental marketing claims, including how consumers are likely to interpret particular claims and how marketers can substantiate these claims to avoid deceiving consumers.The FTC says it is requesting general comments on the continuing need for the guides, their economic impact, their effect on the accuracy of various environmental claims and their interaction with other environmental marketing regulations. The commission also seeks information on consumer perception evidence of environmental claims, including those not in the guides currently.Specific issues the FTC says it expects to get many public comments on include:A list of recent cases brought relating to topics covered by the guides can be found on the FTC’s website.The commission vote approving the publication of a Federal Register notice announcing the opening of the public comment period was 4-0, with Chair Lina M. Khan issuing a separate statement that reads in part: “At a broad level, the questions focus on whether any aspects are outdated and in need of revision. For example, recent reports suggest that many plastics that consumers believe they’re recycling actually end up in landfills. One question, then, is whether claims that a product is recyclable should reflect where a product ultimately ends up, not just whether it gets picked up from the curb. I’m particularly interested in receiving comments, including consumer perception research, on relatively emerging environmental topics.”The notice will be published in the Register in mid-January 2023, after which the FTC will accept comments for 60 days. Information about how to submit comments can be found in the Federal Register notice.Steve Alexander, president and CEO of the APR has voiced the association’s support of the update, saying, “The FTC’s goal in updating the Green Guides should be to help consumers seeking to reduce waste [and] make informed choices about the products and packaging they buy and to ensure that companies make accurate marketing claims about the sustainability of their products.“APR strongly urges the FTC to provide clear guidance on the terms ‘recyclable’ and ‘recycled content’ in the updated Green Guides. In considering these definitions, the FTC’s Green Guides should continue to reflect the facts on the ground and current consumer understanding of these terms, while also leaving room for the innovation and investment that is vital to the success of the industry.”Alexander continues, “Specifically, the FTC should continue to be clear that unqualified ‘recyclable’ claims on packaging are only allowed when a substantial majority of consumers or communities have access to recycling facilities where the item is sold. At the same time, APR recommends that the Green Guides reflect ongoing investment and research by differentiating between those products that could be recyclable at scale and are on the path to meeting performance requirements and those products that are not recyclable at scale and have no pathway to get there.“For ‘recycled content’ claims, the Green Guides should reflect consumer understanding of the recycling process,” he adds. “The FTC should make clear that marketers can only make unqualified claims of recycled content if the entire product or package on which the claim is displayed (excluding minor, incidental components) is made from postconsumer recycled material—products made from material used by households or individuals and placed in recycling bins or as part of a consumer recycling program. The FTC should not allow unqualified claims that products are recycled if they are made from ‘postindustrial’ material—manufacturing scraps or byproduct—or if the claim is based on ‘mass balance’ calculation.”Mass balance calculations often are used for chemically recycled plastic inputs. In a 2021 position statement on chemical recycling, the APR writes that it “has the potential to expand opportunities for recycling of materials that are not recycled by mechanical processes today.”The association adds, “Chemical recycling is not a replacement for mechanical or traditional recycling, but it is a complement to these processes for materials that are rarely recycled mechanically.”Alexander says the APR will submit comments related to the Green Guides to the FTC and participate as a stakeholder in the Green Guides development process.carbon offsets and climate change – The current “Guides” provide guidance on carbon offset and renewable energy claims. The commission invites comments on whether the revised “Guides” should provide additional information on related claims and issues.the term “recyclable” – Among other things, the FTC seeks comments on whether it should change the current threshold that guides marketers on when they can make unqualified recyclable claims, as well as whether the “Guides” should address in more detail claims for products that are collected (picked up curbside) by recycling programs but not ultimately recycled.the term “recycled content” – Comments are requested on whether unqualified claims about recycled content, particularly claims related to “preconsumer” and “postindustrial” content, are widely understood by consumers, as well as whether alternative methods of substantiating recycled content claims may be appropriate.the need for additional guidance – The commission also seeks comment on the need for additional guidance regarding claims such as “compostable,” “degradable,” ozone-friendly,” “organic” and “sustainable, as well as those regarding energy use and energy efficiency.AlvensAlv | stock.adobe.comRecycling TodayPUBLISHED DECEMBER 16, 2022Dec. 15, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced that it is seeking public comment on potential updates and changes to the Guides for the Use of Environmental Claims, also known as the Green Guides.

The Association of Plastic Recyclers (APR), Washington, says it intend to submit comments and to participate in the updating process. “Consumers are increasingly conscious of how the products they buy affect the environment and depend on marketers’ environmental claims to be truthful,” Bureau of Consumer Protection Director Samuel Levine says. “We look forward to this review process and will make any updates necessary to ensure the Green Guides provide current, accurate information about consumer perception of environmental benefit claims. This will both help marketers make truthful claims and consumers find the products they seek.” The FTC first issued the Green Guides in 1992, with revisions issued in 1996, 1998 and 2012. They provide guidance on environmental marketing claims, including how consumers are likely to interpret particular claims and how marketers can substantiate these claims to avoid deceiving consumers. The FTC says it is requesting general comments on the continuing need for the guides, their economic impact, their effect on the accuracy of various environmental claims and their interaction with other environmental marketing regulations. The commission also seeks information on consumer perception evidence of environmental claims, including those not in the guides currently. Specific issues the FTC says it expects to get many public comments on include: carbon offsets and climate change – The current “Guides” provide guidance on carbon offset and renewable energy claims. The commission invites comments on whether the revised “Guides” should provide additional information on related claims and issues. the term “recyclable” – Among other things, the FTC seeks comments on whether it should change the current threshold that guides marketers on when they can make unqualified recyclable claims, as well as whether the “Guides” should address in more detail claims for products that are collected (picked up curbside) by recycling programs but not ultimately recycled. the term “recycled content” – Comments are requested on whether unqualified claims about recycled content, particularly claims related to “preconsumer” and “postindustrial” content, are widely understood by consumers, as well as whether alternative methods of substantiating recycled content claims may be appropriate. the need for additional guidance – The commission also seeks comment on the need for additional guidance regarding claims such as “compostable,” “degradable,” ozone-friendly,” “organic” and “sustainable, as well as those regarding energy use and energy efficiency. A list of recent cases brought relating to topics covered by the guides can be found on the FTC’s website.

Optimize your process today with GK! The commission vote approving the publication of a Federal Register notice announcing the opening of the public comment period was 4-0, with Chair Lina M. Khan issuing a separate statement that reads in part: “At a broad level, the questions focus on whether any aspects are outdated and in need of revision. For example, recent reports suggest that many plastics that consumers believe they’re recycling actually end up in landfills. One question, then, is whether claims that a product is recyclable should reflect where a product ultimately ends up, not just whether it gets picked up from the curb. I’m particularly interested in receiving comments, including consumer perception research, on relatively emerging environmental topics.” The notice will be published in the Register in mid-January 2023, after which the FTC will accept comments for 60 days. Information about how to submit comments can be found in the Federal Register notice. Steve Alexander, president and CEO of the APR has voiced the association’s support of the update, saying, “The FTC’s goal in updating the Green Guides should be to help consumers seeking to reduce waste [and] make informed choices about the products and packaging they buy and to ensure that companies make accurate marketing claims about the sustainability of their products. “APR strongly urges the FTC to provide clear guidance on the terms ‘recyclable’ and ‘recycled content’ in the updated Green Guides. In considering these definitions, the FTC’s Green Guides should continue to reflect the facts on the ground and current consumer understanding of these terms, while also leaving room for the innovation and investment that is vital to the success of the industry.” Alexander continues, “Specifically, the FTC should continue to be clear that unqualified ‘recyclable’ claims on packaging are only allowed when a substantial majority of consumers or communities have access to recycling facilities where the item is sold. At the same time, APR recommends that the Green Guides reflect ongoing investment and research by differentiating between those products that could be recyclable at scale and are on the path to meeting performance requirements and those products that are not recyclable at scale and have no pathway to get there. “For ‘recycled content’ claims, the Green Guides should reflect consumer understanding of the recycling process,” he adds. “The FTC should make clear that marketers can only make unqualified claims of recycled content if the entire product or package on which the claim is displayed (excluding minor, incidental components) is made from postconsumer recycled material—products made from material used by households or individuals and placed in recycling bins or as part of a consumer recycling program. The FTC should not allow unqualified claims that products are recycled if they are made from ‘postindustrial’ material—manufacturing scraps or byproduct—or if the claim is based on ‘mass balance’ calculation.” Mass balance calculations often are used for chemically recycled plastic inputs. In a 2021 position statement on chemical recycling, the APR writes that it “has the potential to expand opportunities for recycling of materials that are not recycled by mechanical processes today.” The association adds, “Chemical recycling is not a replacement for mechanical or traditional recycling, but it is a complement to these processes for materials that are rarely recycled mechanically.” Alexander says the APR will submit comments related to the Green Guides to the FTC and participate as a stakeholder in the Green Guides development process.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.For nearly a year now, LIV has been nearly the only thing anyone in golf has talked about, though likely that excludes many Jacobin readers. Professional golf, after all, is known for such incivilities as possessing a “Caucasians only” clause in its bylaws until 1961 — not exactly a progressive pedigree.Yet the story of the Saudi Arabia–backed LIV Golf, its recent deal with the CW television network, and its larger war with the best-known organization in professional golf, the PGA Tour, may have effects far beyond the sports pages, because it is the story of how what one golf writer called a “rogue’s gallery of assholes,” backed by a brutal, authoritarian petro-state, are leading perhaps the strangest workers’ rights movement of all time.LIV Golf first reached the public’s consciousness at the beginning of 2022, when golf writer Alan Shipnuck published an interview with Phil Mickelson. The long-hitting left-hander is one of the sports’ leading players, having won sixty-four tournaments as a professional (forty-five of them on the PGA Tour), including six majors (the last as a fifty-year old, the oldest ever to do so). While talking to Shipnuck, Mickelson outlined how the new tour would be supported by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), a sovereign wealth vehicle with assets in the realm of $600 billion.Mickelson allowed that the sponsors of the new tour were some “scary motherfuckers to get involved with,” not least because “they killed [Washington Post reporter and US resident Jamal] Khashoggi and have a horrible record on human rights.” However, he argued that the venture represented “a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reshape how the PGA Tour operates.”Mickelson, whose natural habitat is far more swanky country clubs around the world than union halls, thereby became the public face of a movement that, while disdained by golf’s traditionalists, is putting front and center a question on every worker’s mind: pay.What is LIV Golf, and how does it differ from a standard, PGA Tour golf tournament? A standard PGA Tour tournament is conducted over four days by around a hundred fifty golfers playing seventy-two holes, with the lowest individual score winning the event. Each player is assigned a “tee time” over the course of a day, with the earliest players going out to play their rounds early in the morning and the last players no earlier than early afternoon. After two rounds, half the field is “cut,” or sent home without a check.Unlike professional tennis, which has long paid “appearance fees” for its stars, golf has prided itself on rewarding tournament play and tournament play only. The rewards are hefty: the winning player will usually score between a little more than a million dollars to nearly three million, meaning that the best players are incredibly wealthy. The players golf solely for themselves as “lone wolf” independent contractors, excepting the occasional international team competition like the Ryder Cup.According to its founders, LIV Golf is an attempt to “disrupt” golf as it has been played professionally for about the last century. LIV Golf’s tournaments are played by only forty-eight golfers over only fifty-four holes. (“LIV” is “54” in the Roman numeric system.) Where the PGA Tour’s tournament rounds can last all day, LIV Golf’s tournament rounds take a little over five hours due to all the golfers beginning their rounds at the same time, in what’s known as a “shotgun” start.Above all, there is no cut: every player who enters a LIV Golf tournament is guaranteed some prize money. Moreover, each of the golfers is paired with three others as a “team,” which can win money collectively. And this isn’t even to speak of the rock bands and other entertainment LIV hires for its events. The electronic duo Chainsmokers were scheduled to play a recent LIV event, before backing out at the last minute.The music and other differences have, according to many observers, brought an alternative sort of gallery to golf tournaments than the PGA Tour’s events: a difference in audience that parallels the differences between the mainstream Republican Party voter and those for Donald Trump. According to Zach Helfand, writing in the New Yorker last year, “LIV embodie[s] Trumpism,” insofar as it appeals to a “younger audience” that isn’t as invested in the traditional model, either of the sport or politics. It’s no accident, in other words, that the upstart league scheduled two events in its inaugural season, 2022, at golf courses owned by the former president. It’s a louder crowd, more prone to yelling than to the traditional golf clap, and contrasts strongly with the typical golf audience.That audience is beloved by television advertisers, who fight for air time on golf coverage despite the fact that viewership for even the biggest golf events is not large by television sport standards. Not only that, but they’re old: the Golf Channel’s median viewer is far older than that of any other sports network. But as the channel also reports, its audience has the highest income and most representation in the C-suite of any other. Luxury brands know that one of the best ways to reach their target is through golf.What is golf’s appeal to this demographic? One example often cited by the corporate class is an incident from the 1925 US Open involving the great Bobby Jones, who is perhaps best known today as the founder of the Masters tournament and the golf club where it is held, Augusta National, but also won thirteen major championships as a player. During the first round of that tournament, Jones brushed the grass surrounding the eleventh green with his club, resulting in the ball imperceptibly moving. Jones nevertheless called a penalty on himself for violating the rules, which ended up costing him a chance at a win.When Jones was profusely praised by the press afterward, he said: “You might as well praise a man for not robbing a bank.” That sort of integrity is something that corporate America likes to think it prizes highly, and it’s likely to protect that aura that no major television network had, previous to the agreement with the CW Network, which has agreed to televise LIV’S tournaments. “Broadcasts” of these events are distributed on YouTube for free.Despite America’s nearly insatiable appetite for sports programming, in other words, no content distributor — until now — has been willing to televise LIV, apparently to protect golf’s nearly unique prestige as a “gentleman’s game.”Earlier this month, that changed.On January 19, Nexstar Media Group announced it would host the golf events on its CW Network. The terms were not announced. Previously, both Apple TV and Amazon had turned LIV down, while CBS, NBC, and ESPN all had contracts with the PGA Tour. The new television contract has changed the battlefield between the two golf enterprises, considerably raising the upstart’s chances of survival.For traditionalists, LIV Golf has disdain for golf’s sense of its own propriety. They decry the newcomer’s “no cut” format and its shortening of tournament length from seventy-two to fifty-four holes. At times, the response of old school golf types seems more visceral than necessary. Martin Slumbers — chief of the R & A, the body that, with its counterpart the United States Golf Association (USGA), determines the rules of the sport — said last July that LIV undermined “the merit-based culture and the spirit of open competition that makes golf so special.”For many outside observers, LIV Golf is, like Trumpism itself, simply a more obnoxious form of an already-dubious enterprise. That feeling may only increase when the curtains surrounding the new venture are lifted. Saudi Arabia’s moral failings are certainly no secret, as Mickelson’s comments acknowledge. The Middle Eastern monarchy has a 2.4 rating, out of 10, from Human Rights Tracker. It has waged a devastating war on Yemen, backed by the United States, and has a long history of exporting reactionary terrorism around the world. That record is one reason critics allege that the country is funding the new golf tour in the first place, as a form of what’s become known as “sportswashing.”That term is a variation on “greenwashing,” defined as when a “company purports to be environmentally conscious for marketing purposes.” As Ewan Murray pointed out in early January, the LIV investment appears of a piece with other Saudi investments in global sport, such as Cristiano Ronaldo’s high-profile move to the Saudi Arabian soccer league last year. One of the world’s last absolute monarchies has also made investments in Premier League powerhouse Newcastle United and brought a Formula One race to Jeddah, the nation’s commercial capitol. Tyson Fury and Oleksandr Usyk are set to box for the “biggest purse in boxing history” in March. LIV Golf, then, appears to be part of larger-scale attempt to woo sports fans.While that much appears at least semi-obvious, the desert kingdom’s PIF is one of the largest chunks of money sluicing around the planet that is completely invisible to ordinary investors. According to Professor Steffen Hertog of the London School of Economics, for example, it is “opaque, a black box,” meaning that PIF’s financial moves are immune to the usual forms of scrutiny.What is known about the PIF does not inspire trust: the fund has invested with Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, and Steven Mnuchin, Trump’s former secretary of the Treasury, to the tune of two and one billion dollars, respectively. So not only is LIV Golf a more obnoxious version of what some think of as an already pretty obnoxious sport, it’s even more so after drilling down just slightly.Yet despite all the truly sinister details that surround the enterprise, the rising circuit has dramatically raised the purses of its tournaments by comparison with its competitor, the PGA Tour. Whereas the typical golf tournament has a purse of just under $10 million, all of LIV’s tournaments last year had at least $25 million.Those purses are shared by fewer players: in a PGA Tour event, only those who make the cut are paid, but that’s typically around sixty golfers, whereas although all LIV players get paid, there’s fewer of them to start. As absurd as it sounds to depict Mickelson — one of the wealthiest human beings on the planet — and the other LIV golfers as waging class struggle against their bosses, within the rarified world of professional golf, that’s what they are doing.Prior to the arrival of LIV, professional golf had been experiencing many of the same issues as other industries: the growth of managerial power in relation to labor. The previous PGA Tour commissioner, Tim Finchem, received, for example, 5.1 million dollars so long ago as 2009, and five other tour officials made more than 1 million dollars that year. Similar numbers are reported for other golf organizations, reflecting how golf generally is part of the massive upsurge in executive compensation that’s taken place over the past few decades.Most significantly, the Wall Street Journal reported in September that in 2020, tour commissioner Jay Monahan received $14.2 million, which is not only an enormous number in itself but also is ridiculous in relation to another number: Monahan’s salary was roughly twice what 2020’s leading money winner, Justin Thomas, took home ($7,344,040). By joining LIV, professional golfers like Mickelson have, consciously or not, been protesting an imbalance in financial power.One sign that the presence of LIV has affected the PGA Tour is that the tour has addressed that disparity with alacrity ever since LIV first made its appearance. In the first place, the established tour has attempted to placate its stars with something called a “Player Impact Program” (PIP). PIP is essentially a slush fund designed by the PGA Tour to reward players for driving the most “positive impact” on the tour, for the players who aren’t necessarily the best golfers but are famous nonetheless. In other words, the tour has broken one of its most sacrosanct precepts: upholding the legacy of Bobby Jones by only rewarding players for their performance on the golf course.More recently, the tour announced that players who qualified for their “tour cards” by becoming members of the tour would receive a guaranteed $500,000 per year — a first, and another violation of the “Bobby Jones principle.”The LIV golfers aren’t exactly comparable to the autoworkers who held up production on the General Motors line in Flint, Michigan, in the hard winter of 1937. They are a pretty unlikable bunch on the whole: the adjective “surly” usually accompanies LIV player and Masters champion Sergio García, for example. A few years ago, Brooks Koepka offered free beer to anyone heckling fellow player Bryson DeChambeau; now both play for the Saudi-financed operation. These are, in general, not likable people, even for professional golfers.Yet that’s exactly the point. In the same July interview quoted above, golf executive Slumbers denounced LIV players as “entirely driven by money.” That’s exactly the response that should be expected from the golf establishment — when they’re losing. And right now, in a contest with an upstart tour backed by some of the world’s worst human rights abusers, the golf establishment is losing.Daniel Lane is a writer who has worked in the golf industry for nearly thirty years.

77,https://thesustainableagency.com/blog/what-is-greenhushing/,120lh1g,What is Greenhushing? | Meaning & Definition,"Yes, another term in the blizzard of sustainability that’s relevant for you to look out for. Whether you’re running a sustainable business, or you work in marketing, or you’re someone who’s just curious about the way brands communicate to the rest of the world.Either way, our guess is that you’ve definitely heard of greenwashing. The term has been around since 1986 and has been increasing its notoriety for years now. Such widespread knowledge surrounding greenwashing means that brands are being called out for it, almost every week. It’s mainly due to this fear of criticism against sustainability claims that brands have begun greenhushing. Greenhushing was coined more recently, in 2008 by brand strategist Jerry Stifelman and writer Sami Grover in a blog post (now inaccessible) for Treehugger.com.Greenhushing is when companies choose to not communicate their sustainability efforts.Apparently, greenhushing is more common than we think and companies have felt the need to go quiet about their sustainability for a while now. Back in 2016, a study of 31 small rural tourism businesses in the Peak District National Park (UK) who are all certified by the Environmental Quality Mark found that they only communicated 30% of the sustainability actions they practised.

And greenhushing is also not a type of greenwashing, although some people think so. In fact, it’s more accurate to say they’re the opposite. While greenwashing deliberately exaggerates a company’s sustainability claims to mislead people to think that they are more sustainable than they actually are, greenhushing deliberately under-communicates a company’s sustainable practices. So by definition, they’re the inverse of each other. Both are, however, ways that a company is inauthentic about its sustainability.

But greenhushing is not the solution. The inevitable consequence of greenhushing will be a lack of corporate sustainability.

ROMA DHANANI ON MARCH 22, 2023 Yes, another term in the blizzard of sustainability that’s relevant for you to look out for. Whether you’re running a sustainable business, or you work in marketing, or you’re someone who’s just curious about the way brands communicate to the rest of the world. Either way, our guess is that you’ve definitely heard of greenwashing. The term has been around since 1986 and has been increasing its notoriety for years now. Such widespread knowledge surrounding greenwashing means that brands are being called out for it, almost every week. It’s mainly due to this fear of criticism against sustainability claims that brands have begun greenhushing. Greenhushing was coined more recently, in 2008 by brand strategist Jerry Stifelman and writer Sami Grover in a blog post (now inaccessible) for Treehugger.com. Greenhushing is when companies choose to not communicate their sustainability efforts. Apparently, greenhushing is more common than we think and companies have felt the need to go quiet about their sustainability for a while now. Back in 2016, a study of 31 small rural tourism businesses in the Peak District National Park (UK) who are all certified by the Environmental Quality Mark found that they only communicated 30% of the sustainability actions they practised. But it was thanks to the consultancy South Pole that the term gained widespread coverage. Their report in late 2022 on large organisations that have a dedicated sustainability or CSR lead found that 67% have a net-zero target and a science-based target but 23% do not plan to publicise their science-based emissions goals. Greenhushing vs greenwashing Greenhushing should not be mistaken for greenwashing. And greenhushing is also not a type of greenwashing, although some people think so. In fact, it’s more accurate to say they’re the opposite. While greenwashing deliberately exaggerates a company’s sustainability claims to mislead people to think that they are more sustainable than they actually are, greenhushing deliberately under-communicates a company’s sustainable practices. So by definition, they’re the inverse of each other. Both are, however, ways that a company is inauthentic about its sustainability. So in a way the two concepts are like a mirror image. So, why are brands greenhushing? There’s a lot of talk on this. Here are a few of the chief motives that could be at play: The fear of being criticised and getting a bad reputation. This is the most obvious reason. No brand wants to be ‘cancelled’, called out for greenwashing, or publicly shamed for being hypocrites or not doing enough for sustainability.

It would be a pity if the fear of criticism was the leading reason that financial, intellectual, and emotional investment in sustainability started to diminish.

Stricter laws against greenwashing are coming but they should only punish those who are actually greenwashing. If that’s not you, then don’t be stricken by panic and retreat into a shell. Choose your partners carefully. A good agency, for example, should know how to communicate sustainability and avoid the pitfalls of either greenwashing or greenhushing. Quite a few of the most egregious greenwashing cases have been committed by clumsy marketing teams that don’t know the area. Perhaps there is also a lesson for the people looking on too. If we do want a more sustainable world then we need to understand that sustainability can’t happen overnight. A transition needs to happen from a far from perfect place. Of course it’s still important to call out greenwashing brands but not all brands deserve to be scolded. It’s a fine line, and we need to tread it carefully.

It’s been four years since the Open Sustainable Technology project kicked off. At the time, most of the R&D team I’d built up over the previous five years had been fired from DHL/Streetscooter. To give back to the robotics community, we released the Awesome Robotic Tooling list of the best tools for the various autonomous and electric trucks that we built. But how to continue on this path of free and collaborative innovation that I came to love over the years? I decided to shift my career to focus on open technology’s potential for positive long-term impact.To my surprise, no one had yet compiled a comprehensive overview of Open Source Software (OSS) around climate change and sustainability. Sure, there were a few lists on various sustainability topics, but most of them were not updated or only represented a tiny part of this OSS ecosystem.Thanks to the pandemic, my unemployment and the support of friends, the team published early results in September 2021. The feedback was overwhelming. We realized that almost no one had a good understanding of what Open Source could do to help fight climate change and protect our natural world. And no one was talking about the crucial role Open Source was already playing. To this day, Open Sustainable Technology is one of the world’s leading projects that scientifically analyses and advocates how open methods can accelerate a sustainable transition. The fact that a community-based project with no funding and just a few volunteers could archive this was both shocking and motivating at the same time.Typically, OSS ecosystems are created from a user perspective, based on the infrastructure being used, or as part of a larger technical framework or programming language. Few tried to map OSS ecosystems based on common real-world applications and issues. I regularly heard that our approach was crazy and technically unfeasible given the number of projects in the field. Since I was also starting a PhD in Atmospheric Science, I was able to leverage my studies to continue curating strong research projects in the field around the world for fun.When the attention started to fade and most of the supporting contributors started working on other projects, an efficient way of deciding whether a project is worth listing or not was needed. The challenge with climate and sustainability projects is to filter out relevant projects from the noise. Which project can be reused and create added value for other OSS projects and developers? So instead of judging the quality of a project and its source code, I focused on external usage indicators like download numbers and issues from users outside of the projects.My studies, previous work experience and various glossaries helped me find the relevant keywords. Clouds, for example, provide one of the most difficult aspects of climate forecasting, but it’s almost impossible to find relevant projects because they’re buried under a mass of cloud computing. The same goes for terms like ocean, sea, environment, atmosphere, battery and carbon.“The OSS community has a hard time gathering around relevant topics because they cannot find each other and are forced to reinvent the wheel over and over again. I’m still convinced that the main problem with OSS sustainability is the lack of a comprehensive search engine to help you find the right (active and documented) projects for your use case.”A year into the project, I started to lose motivation. It’s a shame to see how many projects in this area don’t get any further development after their release, even if you see how hard they try to build community. I estimate that more than 95% of the thousands of repositories I reviewed are now inactive. Research in this area is incredibly exciting due to the diverse technologies and methods employed, but it also underscores the pressing nature of many environmental challenges. What kept me going was the unique insight I was able to create for myself and others. There’s a huge, untapped potential for OSS to make an impact on climate and biodiversity. This potential extends beyond scientific research to business practices and systemic changes for a sustainable future.Openness about environmental models, data and statements is the most important indicator of genuine sustainability efforts. The very nature of environmental sustainability demands such openness: Our planet is simply too complex to argue with black boxes. Explaining, planning and forecasting requires a way to iterate in the open to improve assumptions and models over the long term.The database already showed clear trends, such as the lack of companies and for-profits. It also became clear that where traceable numbers are bad for business as usual, OSS and open science play a tiny role, even though software and high-quality numbers are highly relevant. So far, these include in particular carbon offsets, anything related to corporate ‘climate neutrality,’ corporate emissions, sustainable investment and carbon capture. As part of this ‘gap’ analysis, it’s clear that there is no existing open-source climate model with verifiable scientific data that can refute the claim of long-term environmental destruction caused by climate change. However, there are a variety of smaller and larger, along with their supporting data, that reinforce this alarming trend.I started writing blog posts about the findings, e.g. about the lack of OSS in sustainable investment and how this relates to the lack of reproducibility of collaborative sustainability ratings. To my surprise, these reached hundreds of thousands of people worldwide. After seeing how easy it was to innovate and create climate action with OSS, I kept giving talks and writing articles to motivate others. That said, I still don’t understand why the “Open Source Way” is so little understood, promoted and propagated in the climate and sustainability community. Accurate and transparent quantification of a technology’s sustainability can help mitigate the uncertainty caused by political manipulation and lobbying. Simply asking for open models and open science from relevant people for technologies such as biofuels or carbon capture would put an end to the misinformation in these fields.At about that one-year mark, Eirini Malliaraki contacted me to report that she had a grant from Subak to help analyze the projects found so far. Without her help and the refreshed motivation, the project might have been abandoned. The two of us bolstered each other to write the first report on The Open Source Sustainability Ecosystem, with Josh Hopkins joining later on.Fortunately, at the beginning of the project, we decided to focus on Git repositories. This allowed us to retrieve metadata about the projects and organizations using the APIs of the Git platforms. We also found Open Source ecosystem analysis in general to be a fascinating new scientific field. Introducing a new health indicator, like the Development Distribution Score, allowed us to get a first impression of the community. As in a natural ecosystem, we can study similar quantities such as diversity of topics, organizational structures, global distribution and how these projects can be ‘preserved’.At one of the conferences presenting our findings, met Andrew Nesbitt of Ecosyste.ms. With his help, the analysis jumped to the next level. Download numbers from almost all package managers and citations of projects based on their DOI (Digital Object Identifier) were added to the metadata. Linking Open Source repositories to articles and papers using the DOI, which is available for a growing number of scientific projects, has greatly increased the amount of data available. Citations can be used to gauge the relevance of a project. More automation and various methods such as embedding, unearthed hundreds of additional projects. In addition to some online marketing for the ecosystem, we started to build some additional services for the projects collected, such as ClimateTriage.com, to help developers contribute and join an open-climate community.However, with over 1,000 organizations and 2,000 projects, it was becoming increasingly difficult to find new projects. For many, the project became my personal project and I found it difficult to restore the sense of community and shared responsibility that existed in the beginning.The team investigated whether new open access scientific publications could be discovered based on the keywords collected over the years. We also investigated how methods such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLM) could be applied to our dataset.The roadblock? We weren’t able to find funding for this or most of our other work. Confession: This was largely my fault because I had avoided establishing a funding source and legal organization early on. With the project’s popularity surging to fourth place in the ecosystem with over 2,000 stars, I was optimistic about securing funding if needed.Since almost all of the “awesome” lists in this space gave up years ago, we needed a strategy to maintain the existing one as more people started to rely on our insights and data. Otherwise, we would have failed in our mission, leaving behind a clustered space of OSS projects with little collaboration between them because they simply don’t know about each other.To take Open Sustainable Technology to the next level, our community is leading the way in exploring various follow-up projects. These include creating a fund as an additional service for the Open Source ecosystem. Allocating funds to critical projects and their dependencies with low-health indicators could help maintain some of the most important infrastructure for our future. Distributing funding based on project metadata would significantly reduce the administrative overhead that funds struggle with. Relying on various project metrics would make a much more transparent how and why funding is distributed.The team is also looking into creating a news feed about new environmental OSS projects as they’re published, based on keywords found over the years. Andrew came up with the idea of searching all new open-access papers with our keywords for software and data repositories.That said, the path forward for the project isn’t crystal clear. Because it relies on my personal resources and volunteers, it’s impossible to draw up a detailed roadmap. Much depends on whether the future prototype we build takes off and creates strong ties between the community members. Fortunately, the project’s low running costs will enable us to sustain efforts to keep building this OSS climate and sustainability analysis and directory indefinitely. A free community offers many advantages, as we can innovate and express ourselves without restrictions like shareholders. I’ve learned this firsthand over the years.I’m a firm believer that Open Source is one of the most important pieces of the climate change puzzle. It’s impossible to prove but to integrate environmental concerns into our number-driven economies, we need traceable software, data, and models. Without these, sustainability remains a mere concept. Recognizing open source’s potential in this area is crucial to bridging this gap.Are you interested in helping out? Just join one of our public workshops or donate to our Open Collective.

Andrew came up with the idea of searching all new open-access papers with our keywords for software and data repositories. That said, the path forward for the project isn’t crystal clear. Because it relies on my personal resources and volunteers, it’s impossible to draw up a detailed roadmap. Much depends on whether the future prototype we build takes off and creates strong ties between the community members. Fortunately, the project’s low running costs will enable us to sustain efforts to keep building this OSS climate and sustainability analysis and directory indefinitely. A free community offers many advantages, as we can innovate and express ourselves without restrictions like shareholders. I’ve learned this firsthand over the years. Get involved I’m a firm believer that Open Source is one of the most important pieces of the climate change puzzle. It’s impossible to prove but to integrate environmental concerns into our number-driven economies, we need traceable software, data, and models. Without these, sustainability remains a mere concept. Recognizing open source’s potential in this area is crucial to bridging this gap. Are you interested in helping out? Just join one of our public workshops or donate to our Open Collective.

Hayek was an author and economist who wrote a critique of centralized fascist and communist governments in his famous book, ""The Road to Serfdom,"" in 1944. His work was later celebrated as a call for free-market capitalism. Say what you will about Friedrich Hayek and his merry band of economists, but he made a good point: that markets and access to information make for good choices in aggregate. Better than experts. Or perhaps: the more experts, the merrier. This is not to say that free-market economics will necessarily lead to good environmental outcomes.

With increased scrutiny from regulators and investors, the need to clarify ESG practices and counteract greenwashing is becoming a central theme for many organizations.Thematic investing based on ESG trends has also gained significant interest, driven by Canada's net-zero emissions commitment and growing stakeholder expectations for ESG integration in investment programs. Large Canadian pensions saw sustainable investments rise from $163 billion to $276 billion in one year due to climate concerns and global social issues. And as a Mackenzie Investments study found earlier this year, despite 23 per cent of Canadians currently engaging in sustainable investing, 61 per cent continue to have concerns about trust and transparency, especially when it comes to greenwashing.It’s clear the need for consistent and transparent ESG disclosure standards and regulatory frameworks has accelerated as ESG investing grows. Brian Minns, who’s the senior managing director of responsible investment at University Pension Plan (UPP) and Mary Jane McQuillen, portfolio manager and head of ESG at ClearBridge Investments, part of Franklin Templeton, emphasized that greenwashing, where companies or funds overstate or mislead their commitment to ESG goals, is an issue both acknowledge as a real concern.McQuillen pointed out that the proliferation of ESG-labeled products in recent years, which became more difficult for investors to be able to distinguish the difference between them has led to a “siphoning” process by regulators; particularly in Europe, where the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) now aims to filter out false claims.This has led to stricter requirements for funds to justify their ESG credentials, with many funds having to reclassify or even remove ESG terminology from their names. The latest discussion therein lies around naming conventions and whether companies can use the word ‘sustainability’ in the fund name if they’re not meeting criteria.“You have to have a certain percentage of that in the portfolio to be allowed to use the name ‘sustainability’,” she explains. “Between the disclosure requirements, the categorization, the naming rules, we've seen a lot of funds “deregister themselves”, we’ve seen funds withdrawn from the marketplace or taken off shelves, and we've seen funds change their names to remove sustainability. It’s now caused managers to have a good look at themselves and say, ‘Can we say we do this to the public through these disclosure requirements?’”Minns shared a similar perspective, recognizing that while greenwashing remains a real issue, he sees a correction happening. ""We're in this phase of a little bit of correction on greenwashing and going back to basics,"" he says, adding that this trend will likely lead to more transparency and honesty from companies regarding their ESG commitments.He explains UPP's approach to addressing greenwashing includes a focus on stewardship and clear communication of their investment policies and practices. Minns notes that UPP works to ensure their partners and investment managers are properly identifying and addressing material ESG risks and opportunities. Additionally, UPP aims to be transparent in how they are incorporating ESG considerations to meet their fiduciary duties and investment objectives for their beneficiaries.Minns believes ensuring that companies communicate clearly and truthfully about their ESG practices is vital to maintaining trust and credibility with stakeholders. “People should tell the truth about what they're doing, and they should explain it in terms that their primary stakeholders can understand,” he adds.Looking ahead, both Minns and McQuillen expect ESG integration to remain a focal point for institutional investors, with climate change and social equity likely to dominate the agenda. According to McQuillen, climate change is a particularly urgent issue, with companies increasingly focused on aligning with initiatives like the Paris Agreement and Science Based Targets Initiative. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, she added, is likely to spur further investment in clean energy and environmental initiatives, “including health care, like capping prices for insulin for retirees,” she highlights.While Minns points to the reduction of emitting greenhouse gasses to help mitigate climate change, he asserts that politically, this can be challenging. “We know that society needs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions drastically to address climate change and we have all the tools and technology to do so now, but implementation is a socio-political challenge that citizens around the world need to support.”“Inequality is another challenge our society faces, making it harder to tackle other issues like climate change. If people are disadvantaged and they're finding life difficult, then they're going to find it difficult to adopt to policy changes that they might not see the benefit from for years to come,” he says.Brian Minns, senior managing director of responsible investment at University Pension Plan (UPP); Mary Jane McQuillen, head of ESG at ClearBridge InvestmentsBy Josh Welsh Oct 17, 2024 ShareRELATED ARTICLES"

Hold on a minute, you might say – wasn’t that about 13 COP’s ago? Technically, yes, sort of. But this COP16 is the biodiversity summit that has been held this week in Cali, Colombia.It has seen biodiversity topics covered widely across the media, with the pinnacle perhaps being this Financial Times piece on whether becoming “nature-positive” is the new corporate green goal.That’s not to do any disservice to the long-term decarbonisation commitments that many firms have set out as a central environmental goal over recent years.Halting and reversing biodiversity loss over the next five years is the main ambition for big business that have made such a pledge. The FT reads: “Their expanding presence points to nature’s rise up the corporate agenda. From agribusinesses to asset managers, companies around the world are increasingly touting their ambitions to be “nature positive” alongside their net zero targets.”But it also cautions that claims linked to positive progress on biodiversity are even tougher to back up than those around reduced climate impact.This long read piece in Forbes covers the ground of COP16 well, noting that 90% of countries had to submit biodiversity strategies ahead of the summit, and that nature loss comes with enormous economic risk – approaching $45 trillion, according to one report.Alternatively, try this one in Vox on “the most important event you’ve never heard of, explained”.Despite the lingering questions over the merits of these global summits, the momentum seems to be with nature positivity, or biodiversity enhancement or preservation, being the rising star of corporate sustainability programmes. Not just for the positive change it can enable but in light of the increased understanding of the long-term risk factors. GreenBiz wrote earlier this year that this is because regulation such as the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive has forced disclosure of progress on reducing environmental impacts, which in turn is bringing biodiversity more into the corporate spotlight. The business imperative has become clearer and more companies are making commitments. The question now is whether, post COP16, national governments will step up to the plate too.And as business momentum continues, the achievements in pursuit of corporate ambitions will rightly be under the microscope. Ahead of the talks this week, there was already a call from some companies and NGOs for global standards to be agreed to prevent greenwashing around biodiversity, similar to the measures that have been introduced to counter greenwashing of carbon reduction.The UK Government this week appointed its first nature envoy, not always the most teethy of roles. But as nature-positive goals become more prominent, expect more public scrutiny and potentially specific regulation to ensure that all is as-reported and as-communicated.PRmoment Leaders is our new subscription-based learning programme and community, built by PRmoment specifically for the next generation of PR and communications leaders to learn, network, and lead.Important: Once completing the form we will send you a confirmation link which you will need to click on to confirm your subscription.

The business imperative has become clearer and more companies are making commitments. The question now is whether, post COP16, national governments will step up to the plate too. And as business momentum continues, the achievements in pursuit of corporate ambitions will rightly be under the microscope. Ahead of the talks this week, there was already a call from some companies and NGOs for global standards to be agreed to prevent greenwashing around biodiversity, similar to the measures that have been introduced to counter greenwashing of carbon reduction. The UK Government this week appointed its first nature envoy, not always the most teethy of roles. But as nature-positive goals become more prominent, expect more public scrutiny and potentially specific regulation to ensure that all is as-reported and as-communicated.Written by Steve Earl, partner at Boldt PartnersPRmoment Leaders PRmoment Leaders is our new subscription-based learning programme and community, built by PRmoment specifically for the next generation of PR and communications leaders to learn, network, and lead.

An online meeting with Soltanov was arranged.During the meeting, Soltanov told the potential sponsor that the aim of the conference was ""solving the climate crisis"" and ""transitioning away from hydrocarbons in a just, orderly and equitable manner"".Anyone, he said, including oil and gas companies, ""could come with solutions"" because Azerbaijan’s ""doors are open"".However, he said he was open to discussions about deals too – including on oil and gas.Initially, Soltanov suggested the potential sponsor might be interested in investing in some of the ""green transitioning projects"" Socar was involved in - but then spoke of opportunities related to Azerbaijan's plans to increase gas production, including new pipeline infrastructure.""There are a lot of joint ventures that could be established,"" Soltanov says on the recording. ""Socar is trading oil and gas all over the world, including in Asia.""Soltanov then described natural gas as a ""transitional fuel"", adding: ""We will have a certain amount of oil and natural gas being produced, perhaps forever.""The UN climate science body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, acknowledges there will be a role for some oil and gas up to 2050 and beyond. However, it has been very clear a rapid reduction in CO2 emissions involving “a substantial reduction in fossil fuel use” is essential to limiting warming to 1.5C and that this implies reaching net zero CO2 emissions globally around 2050.In a report examining how to transition to a net zero energy system by 2050 while ensuring stable and affordable energy supplies, the International Energy Agency, the global watchdog on energy, has said this means no new oil and natural gas fields are required beyond those that have already been approved for development.It also goes against the agreement the world made at the last global climate summit to transition away from fossil fuels.Soltanov appeared eager to help get discussions going, telling the potential sponsor: ""I would be happy to create a contact between your team and their team [Socar] so that they can start discussions.""A couple of weeks later the fake Hong Kong investment company received an email - Socar wanted to follow up on the lead.Attempting to do business deals as part of the COP process appears to be a serious breach of the standards of conduct expected of a COP official.These events are supposed to be about reducing the world's use of fossil fuels – the main driver of climate change – not selling more.The standards are set by the UN body responsible for the climate negotiations, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).The UN said it could not comment directly on our findings but remarked that ""the same rigorous standards"" are applied to whoever hosts the conference, and that those standards reflect ""the importance of impartiality on the part of all presiding officers"".Its code of conduct for COP officials states they are ""expected to act without bias, prejudice, favouritism, caprice, self-interest, preference or deference, strictly based on sound, independent and fair judgement.""They are also expected to ensure that personal views and convictions do not compromise or appear to compromise their role and functions as a UNFCCC officer.""Christiana Figueres, who oversaw the signing of the 2015 Paris agreement to limit global temperature rises to well below 2C, told the BBC that she was shocked anyone in the COP process would use their position to strike oil and gas deals.She said such behaviour was ""contrary and egregious"" to the the purpose of COP and ""a treason"" to the process.The BBC has also seen emails between the COP29 team and the fake investors.In one chain, the team discusses a $600,000 (£462,000) sponsorship deal with a fake company in return for the Socar introduction and involvement in an event about ""sustainable oil and gas investing"" during COP29.Officials offered five passes with full access to the summit and drafted a contract which initially required the firm to make some commitments to sustainability. Then it pushed back, one requirement was dropped and ""corrections"" were considered to another.The BBC asked Azerbaijan's COP29 team and Socar for comment.

92,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20240202-has-b-corp-certification-turned-into-corporate-greenwashing,1gr7xos,"As greenwashing soars, some people are questioning B Corp certification","B Corp designations are meant to signal companies are socially and environmentally conscious. Yet experts and other businesses alike say the certification process needs a closer look.In more than 80 countries, consumers can find products emblazoned with a large ""B"" – the marker of B Corporation.For-profit companies – mostly small and privately-owned – must clear a high bar to receive the certification from US-based non-profit B Lab Global, which signals businesses have met certain social and environmental standards. Multinational heavy hitters including Ben & Jerry's, Patagonia, Aesop, Allbirds and The Body Shop carry the designation, along with more than 8,000 other companies.Yet increasingly, B Corp certification doesn't seem so shiny and definitive – and some consumers and companies alike are wondering if the label is greenwashing, or just another fading buzzword, like ""ESG"".In late January, B Lab made headlines when they announced they would launch a formal investigation into the B Corp status of four Havas media agencies following the company's controversial multi-million-dollar account with fossil-fuel giant Shell in September. Twenty-six B Corp advertising firms from Clean Creatives, a collective of media companies cutting ties with fossil-fuel clients, have put pressure on the organisation to strip the subsidiary companies of accreditationThis isn't the first time the legitimacy of the certification has been called into question. Yet the issue has intensified since the introduction of B Lab's B Movement Builders initiative in 2020 – a certification programme specifically for publicly-traded companies with at least $1bn (£790,000) in revenue, which has led to more multinational companies gaining certification.The backlash hit fever pitch in 2022, when a group of B Corp-certified coffee companies alongside Portland, Oregon-based non-profit Fair World Project, wrote an open letter to B Lab Global as Nestlé-owned coffee company Nespresso received its B Corp designation in April that year. Calling out Nespresso's ""abysmal track record on human rights"" and ""extractive business model"", they asked for stricter standards across B Lab Global. Later that year, the certification came under fire again when another open letter from workers at British beer B Corp Brewdog alleged a ""culture of fear"", in which workers were bullied and ""treated like objects"", despite Brewdog achieving its highest scores in the worker-assessment areas. Brewdog subsequently lost its certification.Beyond the B Corp designation, other certifications have arisen – which Matthew Cotton, professor of public policy at Teesside University, UK, says has muddied the water for consumers who want to purchase ethically. ""The sheer volume of different certification schemes means that consumers are becoming confused about which of these schemes is legitimate.""Now, as misinformation and growing consumer awareness around greenwashing spreads, the role of certifications is shifting – in many cases, diminishing. ""Certification is increasingly viewed as one part of a broader strategic approach to sustainability rather than the endpoint,"" says Robert Strand, the executive director of the Center for Responsible Business at the Berkeley Haas School of Business, California.One issue these controversies has exposed is the questionable nature of qualifying for B Corp status in the first place.At present, to become B Corp certified, for-profit companies must complete a B Impact Assessment and obtain a score of at least 80 points out of 200 across several categories that look at the positive impact of the company in relation to its workers, community, consumers and the environment. It can take up to a year to complete; must be renewed every three years; and costs between $1,000 and $45,000 (£789 to £35,483), the fee relative to the company's annual revenue.Yet whether they get certified is contingent on self-reporting – and some critics of the B Corp designation say this approach to assessment is opaque, even flawed. ""Academics and ethical consumer action organisations have argued that it makes it relatively easy to manipulate internal reporting procedures or misrepresent findings,"" says Cotton.Beyond this, the model puts the choice of sustainable goals in the hands of businesses. Cotton says companies may prioritise what is easier to implement versus what is better for the environment: ""for example, prioritising single-use plastic reduction to show their environmental credentials, at the expense of a more urgent need to decarbonise their supply chain"". This can mislead consumers in some cases, he says. ""They are persuaded by the B Corp stamp of approval to buy products that wouldn't meet their personal ethical standards.""Not only might this undermine a company's B Corp status – hurting both businesses and consumers – on a wider scale, Cotton also believes this process adds to a growing climate of greenwashing. ""This may mean that certain companies greenwash their businesses by receiving accolades for their social and environmental performance without actually providing strong benefits to society and the natural environment,"" he says.Despite expert doubt, B Lab says they stand by the process. Chris Turner, executive director of B Lab UK, highlights how companies must re-certify every three years by completing the B Impact Assessment and verification process from scratch. (Post-publication, a representative from B Lab UK reached out to the BBC to note they take steps to verify companies' data.)He is also aware of the challenges B Lab faces, and points to how the company is seeking public feedback as part of their second consultation process (following the first in 2021) as well as prioritising accessibility. For instance, a recent UK campaign offered free B Corp Certification to businesses led by people of colour, women, people with disabilities and members of the LGBTQ+ community. He says that small-to-medium enterprises still make up 96% of their B Corp community.Looking to the future, Strand believes the B Corp status is still relevant, but only when seen as one part of the puzzle.Moving forward, he thinks companies should approach B Corp certification as a foundational step in a larger sustainability strategy. ""The example set by Patagonia [in which its billionaire founder gave away his company to a charitable trust] suggests a trend where companies will seek to compliment certification with additional measures, such as changes in corporate governance or ownership structures, to ensure long-term adherence to their mission and values,"" he says.Cotton is more sceptical, and thinks the process needs to go further. ""For such certification schemes to be more than just greenwashing and to achieve the necessary changes to halt climate emergencies, there needs to be stronger government-backed regulatory schemes that demand better environmental performance from industry.""Settling on a certification system that works for everyone will never be simple. Any signal to a consumer can be good – including B Corp – but it's more complicated than a label on a package.Updated 7 Feb 2023: This piece has been updated to include a comment from B Lab clarifying their process around data verificationShareSaveElizabeth BennettFeatures correspondentAlamyGetty ImagesA flawed process?They are persuaded by the B Corp stamp of approval to buy products that wouldn't meet their personal ethical standards – Matthew CottonWorking in tandemEarthAs greenwashing soars, some people are questioning B Corp certification6 February 2024 Share Save Elizabeth Bennett Features correspondentMany consumers see the B Corp logo as a signal of corporate responsibility (Credit: Alamy)Nespresso came under fire after receiving their B Corp designation in 2022 (Credit: Getty Images)Athleta was certified as a B Corp in 2018 (Credit: Alamy)Sustainable business Earth Features How we work"
