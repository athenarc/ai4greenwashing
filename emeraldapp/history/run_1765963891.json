        "justification": "Snippet 7 states Acme Corporation goal is to convert “100% of packaging to be recyclable or compostable by 2025”. However, Snippet 4 states that in 2022, only 58% of KDP plastic packaging fit the definition of “recyclable” as defined by the Ellen MacArthur Global Commitment (a 30% recycling rate across geographies of 400m or more inhabitants). Additionally, Snippet 3 states “check locally — not recycled in many communities”, indicating that even packaging *designed* to be recyclable may not actually *be* recyclable depending on local infrastructure. Therefore, claiming 92% recyclability/compostability is misleading as it doesn’t account for the limitations of recycling infrastructure and the fact that a significant portion of their packaging isn’t actually recyclable by global standards.",
