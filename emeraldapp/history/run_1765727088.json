This improvement was realized while total business activity increased substantially, including higher product volumes and expanded global distribution. Management considers emissions intensity a key performance indicator for tracking environmental efficiency as operations scale, and the 2022 result reflects progress toward reducing the carbon footprint per unit of activity rather than an absolute percentage reduction in total emissions."

The reduction was driven by operational efficiency initiatives and changes in sourcing and logistics. While absolute emissions declined during the reporting period, the Company did not report a 10% reduction in total greenhouse gas emissions for 2022, and results should be interpreted in the context of business growth and external market conditions."

This transition supported reductions in Scope 2 emissions and contributed to improved overall emissions performance. Additional measures implemented during the year included supply-chain optimization, materials innovation, and ongoing assessment of lifecycle impacts, which together supported the reported reduction in greenhouse gas emissions intensity."
