50,10 Ways Delta Advanced the More Sustainable Future of Flying in 2022,,esgnews.com,https://esgnews.com/10-ways-delta-advanced-the-more-sustainable-future-of-flying-in-2022/,"Delta continued building momentum in 2022 on its journey to connect people to a more sustainable future of flying. From welcoming a new CSO and developing innovative partnerships, to advancing sustainable aviation fuel markets and further reducing single-use plastics onboard, work across the global carrier in 2022 has set Delta apart as a sustainability leader in the aviation sector.

As Delta continues on its path to net zero emissions by 2050, here are some of the ways it has been working this year to embed sustainability in everything it does, while working to eliminate its climate impact from flying.

1. New CSO Pam Fletcher tapped to lead Delta’s path to net zero emissions by 2050

Auto industry innovation leader Pam Fletcher joined Delta in 2022 as the first chief sustainability officer to also be named a member of the Delta Leadership Committee – a group of senior leaders responsible for the airline’s strategic direction.

From her years helping build a zero-emissions future for automobiles, Pam experienced first-hand that big challenges inspire innovation – but that dramatic change demands all stakeholders to contribute more than their part to be successful. Delta’s approach to achieving net-zero aviation includes working across Delta divisions and with innovative partners and stakeholders to develop a portfolio of short-, medium- and long-term actions – all while remaining committed to Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) targets implemented via fleet renewals, operational efficiencies and scaling Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF).

2. Waste reduction and recycling

In 2022, Delta refreshed its onboard product offerings with artisan-made amenity kits, recycled bedding, reusable and biodegradable service ware and premium canned wine. Together, the products reduce onboard single-use plastic consumption by approximately 4.9 million pounds per year – that’s roughly the weight of 1,500 standard-sized cars – while significantly increasing Delta’s support of minority- and women-run businesses.

3. More sustainable ground operations

Delta deepened its commitment to investing in more sustainable ground operations in 2022 by setting a goal to electrify 50% of its ground service equipment by 2025. Progress is already well underway with 100% of purchases of eligible core fleet equipment being fully electric (baggage tractors, belt loaders, and aircraft tow tractors) in 2022. Furthermore, two major hubs, BOS and SLC, are getting close to 100% electrified for these core fleets.

4. A more transparent supply chain

Delta continued to integrate sustainability into its entire business strategy by partnering with Ecovadis to create transparency across Delta’s supply chain processes and alignment of values when it engages suppliers. Ecovadis provides an ESG ranking for every vendor in Delta’s global supply chain, allowing Delta to measure the impact of its supply chain, encourage vendors to take action to improve their scores and identify potential new vendors with strong sustainability rankings.

5. The power of Delta people in the community

Taking action in the communities where Delta people live work and serve is core to Delta’s values. In 2022, Delta partnered with organizations and employees volunteered to improve local environments. Whether organized via Delta’s Community Engagement team or the sustainability-focused business resource group known as Green Up, these efforts included:

Partnering with Trees Atlanta, Tree People in Los Angeles, Speak for the Trees in Boston and Forterra in Seattle to plant more than 650 trees in low-income communities and neighborhoods of color across nine cities.

Partnering with Captain Planet Foundation to create outdoor learning gardens at schools in Atlanta, New York City and Seattle to engage and empower young people to problem solve environmental challenges.

Organizing employee volunteer opportunities resulting in: Beach and River clean-ups in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Atlanta and on the Jersey Shore A city-wide canal clean-up in Amsterdam that included volunteers from Dutch airline KLM The removal of around 4,000 pounds of non-native ice plant from the dunes off the end of the runways at LAX

6. Cleaner fuel: SAF advancements

Delta has committed to fueling 10% of its operation with SAF by the end of 2030. Strong progress toward this goal was made in 2022, despite existing annual global SAF supply being insufficient to operate a fleet Delta’s size for even a single day. The global airline created demand signals for the SAF market and encouraged greater investment in the space, by:

Signing agreements with SAF makers for half the volume needed by 2030. These agreements also expand availability of this nascent technology and align with Delta’s SAF goal as a founding member of the First Movers Coalition. Gevo expects to deliver roughly 75 million gallons of SAF annually for seven years to Delta, anticipated to start mid-2026. DG Fuels plans to deliver 55 million gallons of SAF annually for seven years using a new supply stream, anticipated to start delivery by the end of 2027. This SAF will likely reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by between 75% – 85% compared to conventional jet fuel.

Collaborating with customers on SAF purchase agreements Through more than 50 SAF partnerships, Delta and its corporate, travel agency and cargo customers have committed to purchasing more than 2.5 million gallons of SAF to date, showing that more sustainable travel solutions are a priority across industries

Illustrating how aviation’s existing infrastructure is ready for SAF In 2022 Delta worked with Neste and Colonial Pipeline to test and show how the current fuel infrastructure is already ready to carry SAF to airports along the east coast.

Advocating for policy incentives needed to support the growth of the nascent SAF market and its US producers. In 2022 Delta worked alongside our suppliers and industry partners to support enactment of the first SAF-specific federal incentives; achieving cost competitiveness for SAF relative to on-road biofuels and conventional jet fuel will require further policy momentum and sustained investment.



SAF is extraordinary because it can lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by 80% versus conventional jet fuel and is a proven technology that can be dropped into today’s aircraft with no modification to fuel cells or engines.

7. Fleet innovation

2022 saw Delta’s fleet, once again, become more efficient. Building on work to fast-track the retirement of older aircraft during the two previous years, Delta welcomed the A321neo into service in 2022, powered by Pratt & Whitney GTF™ engines that offer 20% greater fuel efficiency over Delta’s A321ceos. Delta also ordered 100 Boeing 737-10s that are scheduled for delivery beginning in 2025. The 737-10 aircraft will be 20-30% more fuel efficient than the aircraft they’ll replace, reinforcing one of Delta’s strategic fleet objectives to lower emissions.

8. More fuel-efficient aircraft operations: Carbon Council

More than 10 million gallons of fuel were saved in 2022 thanks to the work of Delta’s Carbon Council, that launched in 2022. Made up of leaders from across the airline, the council drives fuel savings initiatives that align with the airline’s Science Based Target initiative commitments. Teams across Delta have worked together to make an impact through fleet modifications, enhanced landing procedures, and optimizations to flight routing and speed.

One example of the Carbon Council’s work is the decision to install enhanced split scimitar winglets for drag reduction on the 737-800 fleet. Once complete, this investment alone is expected to save an estimated 3.3 million gallons of fuel annually. Another example is Delta’s active role with Air Traffic Control and Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) to implement Established on Required Navigation Performance (EoR) in 2021 and 2022. This technology allows air traffic controllers to take advantage of more efficient next-generation procedures to save fuel and time.

9. Revolutionary fleet industry partnership

In 2022, Delta worked with other companies creating potentially disruptive technologies that could accelerate progress toward net zero aviation. One example is Delta’s Memorandum of Understanding to become the first U.S.-based airline to collaborate with Airbus on the research and development of hydrogen-powered aircraft and the ecosystem required to make the transition.

This fall, Delta announced a partnership with Joby Aviation to pioneer home-to-airport transportation using eVTOL aircraft expected to offer zero operating emissions. While the partnership is centered on elevated customer experience, it illustrates how Delta puts sustainability at the center of every significant business decision.

10. The power of collaboration

Decarbonizing aviation will require collaboration and shared knowledge across the industry and beyond. Taking part in the SkyTeam Alliance’s Sustainable Flight Challenge was one way in 2022 that Delta used the power of its airline partnerships to test and explore sustainability solutions including:

400 gallons of SAF from supplier Gevo, marking a record for the largest amount of SAF used on a flight out of Atlanta

100% electric ground service equipment (tractors, and carts that loaded baggage and fuel) in Atlanta and Salt Lake City

Pillows and blankets made from recycled plastic bottles

Sustainable menu options like meat sourced from ranches that practice regenerative land management and locally grown vegetables

Zero disposable plastic, all-recycled packaging and composting of food scraps to make it a zero-waste flight, with the exception of safety, health and hygiene items that may be single use.

Collaboration outside the industry that brings new perspectives is also a key to Delta’s approach to accelerating its path to net zero emissions. Delta in 2022 launched a collaboration with MIT’s Department of Aeronautics to test methods and develop tools to eliminate persistent contrails – these are about 10% of all contrails and thought to be one of aviation’s largest environmental impacts. Avoiding air space prone to producing persistent warming contrails could quickly reduce aviation’s climate impact over the next few years. The study’s findings and technology will be publicly released and published under an open-source license to foster further collaboration and help the industry study and curtail the adverse effects of contrails.",esg_news,2023-01-04 21:56:53+00:00,2025-05-07 13:54:30.062050,"['Delta', 'CS', 'Delta', 'Delta', 'CS', 'Delta', 'Delta', 'Delta Leadership Committee', 'Delta', 'Delta', 'Aviation Fuel', 'Delta', 'Delta', 'Delta', 'SL']",Delta,2023.0,delta,1.000000238418579

2608,"National Safety Council, Amazon and Top Industry Employers Pledge to Reduce Workplace Injuries by 25% by 2025",,esgnews.com,https://esgnews.com/national-safety-council-amazon-and-top-industry-employers-pledge-to-reduce-workplace-injuries-by-25-by-2025/,"This commitment will benefit millions of workers worldwide

Kicking off National Safety Month, and one year after announcing a historic partnership with Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), the National Safety Council (NSC) unveiled the first-of-its-kind MSD Pledge to reduce the most common workplace injury, musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). Today, during the inaugural Workplace Safety Summit: Business Action to Prevent Musculoskeletal Injuries, more than 15 of the nation’s leading organizations joined this effort and signed the pledge to improve workplace safety, reduce MSD risk, and enhance all workers’ well-being.

MSDs – such as tendinitis, back strains and sprains, and carpal tunnel syndrome – impact nearly a quarter of the world’s population and are the leading cause of worker disability, early retirement, and limitations to gainful employment. The MSD Pledge seeks to create safer outcomes for millions of workers worldwide by reducing these injuries by 25% by 2025. By making critical changes, employers will also build more equitable workplaces for frontline workers and communities of color, which are two groups disproportionately impacted by MSDs.

by promoting a workplace where safety excellence, transparency, and accurate reporting are equally valued, and where everyone, at every level of the organization, is accountable for the safety and health of workers. Commit to a significant reduction of MSD injuries by creating safer outcomes for millions of workers worldwide and reducing MSD risk and subsequent injuries by 25% by 2025.

“While there are no sirens associated with MSDs, their impact is alarming and the damage does not stop when workers leave for the day,” said Lorraine Martin, NSC president and CEO. “At NSC, our mission is not only to save lives, but also to prevent injuries and we are asking employers everywhere to join the MSD Pledge and keep workers safe, so they can spend more time doing the things they love with the people they love – which is precisely what this month, National Safety Month, represents.”

“We’re always investing in new ways to keep our employees safe, and we look forward to working with NSC and the companies that sign this pledge to keep getting better every day,” said Heather MacDougall, Amazon vice president for workplace health and safety. “MSDs are a challenge across many different industries, and this pledge will bring together forward-thinking leaders and allow us to share successes and innovate on behalf of all our employees.”

In addition to accessing free resources and sharing safety innovations to help reduce MSD risks, MSD Pledge members will participate in the MSD Solutions Index, an annual company index that analyzes the benefits of the pledge over time. The index will aggregate data on risk reduction strategies, workplace safety culture, and innovation and collaboration, while also identifying areas for targeted action and uncovering trends to inform future approaches. MSD Pledge members benefit from free events, training and coaching opportunities from the Council’s team of ergonomics experts, as well as opportunities to share best practices and lessons learned with one another. Participation in the MSD Pledge is free and open to any employer that is committed to identifying and reducing risks of MSD injuries and creating a culture of safety at work.

“All employees, no matter what company you work for, deserve a safe workplace,” said Donald Flores, United Airlines ramp service employee. “Every day I work hard, safe and smart with the expectation to get back home so I can live my fullest life. I’m proud to work for United and appreciate the high safety standards that are in place to reduce injuries.”

The MSD Pledge was developed at the MSD Solutions Lab, a groundbreaking initiative established as part of the NSC and Amazon partnership to solve this omnipresent safety challenge. Led by NSC, the pledge is one of several initiatives launching in 2022 to achieve the program goal of preventing MSDs before they start, including:

Advisory Council : NSC has named the founding members of the advisory council for this groundbreaking program.

2616,48% of Amazon Shareholders Agree: It’s Time for the Company to Disclose its Plastic Packaging Footprint and Commit to Reductions Going Forward,,esgnews.com,https://esgnews.com/48-of-amazon-shareholders-agree-its-time-for-the-company-to-disclose-its-plastic-packaging-footprint-and-commit-to-reductions-going-forward/,"Resolution receives most votes of multiple resolutions considered by the company.

This week, at Amazon’s annual meeting, 48% of the company’s shareholders voted in favor of a resolution asking the e-commerce giant to address its growing plastic packaging problem, falling just short of a majority. The resolution was presented by Conrad MacKerron, Senior Vice President of As You Sow, the non-profit organization that filed the resolution. The resolution, which called for the company to issue a report on its plastic packaging footprint and commit to reducing that footprint going forward, received the most support of any of the multiple resolutions considered at the meeting, with 181,296,823 votes in favor.

Oceana’s Senior Vice President Matt Littlejohn said, “Nearly half of Amazon shareholders have spoken up for the oceans, sending a clear message that it’s time for the company to address its contribution to the plastic pollution problem. Amazon’s plastic packaging – as Oceana’s most recent report indicated – grew by nearly 29% in just one year. Sea turtles and other ocean animals often mistake plastic for food, which can ultimately prove fatal. Amazon is a data-driven company and has indicated to Oceana that it already measures its plastic use. It’s time for the company to be transparent about its plastic packaging and commit to quantifiable and time-bound company-wide goals to reduce it.”

Ahead of this year’s meeting, Oceana called on Amazon employees (who are also company shareholders) on the ground at Amazon’s headquarters in Seattle and Arlington, VA to win support for the resolution. The campaign featured photos of ocean animals eating or being covered by ocean plastic along with the headline “AMZN: Less plastic, please.” This effort included canvassers, mobile billboards, 1,000-yard signs, 500 posters, and a LinkedIn campaign. Oceana also sent a letter to Amazon shareholders outlining five reasons to support this resolution and created a dedicated website for the endeavor.

Additionally, Oceana rallied support for the resolution from Signatories to the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). Many of the institutional investors owning Amazon shares are members of the PRI and have pledged to seek disclosure on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues by the companies they invest in. Oceana called on these investors to honor their commitment to the PRI and vote in favor of the resolution, which would seek such disclosure on plastic pollution – an immensely important ESG issue. Three of these companies publicly declared their intent to support the resolution.

Providing rationale for voting in favor of the resolution, EFG Asset Management stated, “Concern over the environmental damage caused by plastics is rising and regulations are likely to go into force in a number of jurisdictions that would limit the amount of single-use plastic packaging that can be used. Such additional disclosure as is being requested by the proponent would help shareholders gauge whether the company is appropriately managing risks related to the creation of plastic waste.”

2792,SHEIN Sets Ambition to Become Global Leader in Rescuing Industry’s Excess Inventory through Circular Economy Technology in Partnership with Queen of Raw,,esgnews.com,https://esgnews.com/shein-sets-ambition-to-become-global-leader-in-rescuing-industrys-excess-inventory-through-circular-economy-technology-in-partnership-with-queen-of-raw/,"Listen to this story:

SHEIN, a global e-retailer of fashion, beauty and lifestyle products, and Queen of Raw, a global circular economy technology company whose flagship software, Materia MX, specializes in solving supply chain’s excess inventory issues for the world’s Fortune 500, announced a partnership to support SHEIN’s ambition of becoming a leading rescuer of high-quality deadstock materials. Through repurposing other brands’ excess inventory, the company will avoid consuming new textile resources, creating a blueprint for alternative business models that leverage circularity to mitigate textile waste and reduce the use of new raw materials.

To reach this goal, SHEIN is utilizing Queen of Raw’s proprietary software, Materia MX, to source existing materials from brands and retailers looking to responsibly clear out their excess fabric inventory rather than have it go to waste in landfills. According to Queen of Raw’s impact measuring algorithms, developed with the support of Solve Innovation Future at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Solve, diverting 1 million yards of fabrics from excess inventory would set SHEIN on the trajectory to become one of the global leaders in repurposing deadstock materials, helping conserve water and preventing the creation of carbon dioxide equivalents that would have been generated through conventional production methods.

“We look forward to supporting one of the world’s leading retailers on its journey to transform its supply chain. SHEIN’s influence in the fashion industry aligns with our position as the global leader in measuring and reporting environmental impacts for excess inventory and waste streams across industries,” said Stephanie Benedetto, CEO of Queen of Raw. “Our technology empowers SHEIN to incorporate local deadstock textiles from other brands into its on-demand business model to optimize future inventory purchases. As a result, climate and water impacts are reduced while enhancing transparency.”

See related article: SHEIN announces Plans to Reduce Emissions within its Operations

Automating SHEIN’s supply chain workflow through the software enables the verification of unused materials that meet both SHEIN’s sourcing requirements and Materia MX’s deadstock standard. These materials are then made available to SHEIN designers to incorporate into products sold on the SHEIN platform. The Materia MX platform also allows SHEIN to track and report the data in line with science-based standards.

Caitrin Watson, director of sustainability at SHEIN, said, “Partnering with Queen of Raw supports our advancement to a more circular system, starting with the design of our products. Since SHEIN’s business model is to create products on demand, we don’t accumulate excess fabric liability, which is one of the biggest financial and sustainability challenges for the fashion industry. We are poised to purchase high-quality surplus materials, helping us to reduce the environmental impact of our products and become a circular solution for other businesses.”

The partnership with Queen of Raw contributes to SHEIN’s newly established sustainability roadmap, evoluSHEIN. This overarching framework, comprised of three key pillars – equitable empowerment, collective resilience, and waste-less innovation – builds on and further guides the company on its sustainability journey by addressing the most critical social and environmental challenges facing the fashion industry today.",esg_standards_news,2023-05-10 20:00:00+00:00,2025-03-31 12:57:20.949355,"['SHEIN', 'Queen of Raw', 'Materia MX', 'SHEIN', 'SHEIN', 'Queen of Raw', 'Materia M', 'Queen of Raw', 'Solve Innovation Future', 'Massachusetts Institute of Technology', 'MIT', 'Solve', 'SHEIN', 'SHEIN', 'Queen of Raw', 'SHEIN', 'C', 'Watson']",SHEIN,2023.0,shein,1.0000001192092896

Lufthansa Group is first European airline to join First Movers Coalition, which aims to decarbonize the heavy industry and transport sectors responsible for 30% of global emissions

Lufthansa’s commitment sends powerful market signal to develop sustainable aviation fuels and decouple CO2 emissions from domestic and international aviation

Coalition is led by World Economic Forum and US Department of State and comprises 76 companies with $12 billion in 2030 purchase commitments for green technologies

The World Economic Forum announced an expansion of the First Movers Coalition (FMC), a global coalition to decarbonize hard-to-abate industries. Lufthansa Group joins the FMC aviation sector as the first European airline group to drive the development of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF).

The latest expansion of the coalition focuses on cleaning up one of the world’s most carbon-intensive industry sectors through purchasing commitments for low-carbon technology.

The FMC has asked for ambitious commitments for airlines, airfare and air-freight purchasers, aircraft manufacturers, fuel producers and airports. Aviation accounts for over 2% of global energy-related CO2 emissions and it is critical that the sector works with governments to make zero-emissions aviation a reality. Members of the FMC aviation sector commit to replacing at least 5% of conventional jet fuel demand with SAF, which reduces life-cycle GHG emissions by 85% or more when compared with conventional jet fuel, and/or using zero-carbon emitting propulsion technologies by 2030.

See related article: Ford, First Movers Coalition Announce Expansion of Commitment to Commercialize Zero-Carbon Tech, Cut Emissions

Speaking during the Berlin Energy Transition Dialogue Conference, Nancy Gillis, Head of the FMC, said: “We need to accelerate the decarbonization of hard-to-abate sectors and long-haul transport. As the Secretariat of the First Movers Coalition, the World Economic Forum is seeking to leverage the power of demand to increase the supply of near-zero emission solutions. Lufthansa’s commitment sends a powerful signal in the development of SAF.”

Christina Foerster, Member of Lufthansa Group’s Executive Board for Customer and Corporate Responsibility, said Lufthansa is the first European airline group to join the coalition. “This underpins our commitment to drive the development, market introduction and use of sustainable aviation fuels. Sustainable aviation fuels are a central element of our CO2 reduction roadmap by 2030, which was validated by the independent Science Based Targets initiative.”

Foerster also emphasized the importance of green hydrogen for the energy transition in aviation.

2967,Amazon to Invest $150 Million in Funds That Provide Underrepresented Entrepreneurs with Access to Capital,,esgnews.com,https://esgnews.com/amazon-to-invest-150-million-in-funds-that-provide-underrepresented-entrepreneurs-with-access-to-capital/,"In addition to providing capital, the new Amazon Catalytic Capital initiative will also offer mentorship and business opportunities to startups led by Black, Latino, Indigenous, women, and LGBTQIA+ founders

Initial fund investments include Collide Capital, Elevate Future Fund, Share Ventures, and TechStars Rising Stars

Amazon announced Amazon Catalytic Capital, a new initiative to invest $150 million in venture capital funds, accelerators, incubators, and venture studios that provide funding to entrepreneurs from underrepresented backgrounds, primarily at the pre-seed/seed stage of venture capital funding. The company will invest in funds that focus on Black, Latino, Indigenous, women, and LGBTQIA+ founders. Amazon expects to support more than 10 funds and over 200 companies through the next year.

“We’ve seen incredibly innovative ideas from underrepresented entrepreneurs—from companies offering inclusive health services for women, to startups helping companies mitigate climate impact for underserved communities—and we’re convinced that an inclusive investment strategy leads to better returns and innovation. We want to ensure that these companies and their founders have the same access to capital as anyone else,” said Peter Krawiec, Amazon’s senior vice president of worldwide corporate development. “We hope that our investment will be catalytic—sparking a force-multiplying effect by inspiring others to invest in these companies, fostering inclusion and innovation, positively impacting communities, and creating generational wealth and financial return.”

In addition to capital, the companies in the funds’ portfolios will receive mentorship from Amazon executives and gain access to resources to support their business and technical strategy. Amazon teams will also work with the startups to identify partnership and product collaboration opportunities that could accelerate their growth.

Historically, underrepresented founders have had less access to startup venture capital and greater difficulties in securing funding to bring ideas to fruition. Studies consistently show that Black, Latino, women, and LGBTQIA+ startup founders are underrepresented across the total number of funded startups. According to PitchBook, women founders received 2% of U.S. venture capital funding in 2021. Similarly, Black-founded and Latino-founded startups attracted only 1% and 2% of U.S. venture capital funding respectively last year as reported by Crunchbase News. Research shows that these inequities create a negative ripple effect for underrepresented entrepreneurs, including reduced access to networks, mentors, and sponsors. Despite these challenges, diverse and inclusive teams are 75% more likely to see ideas become products and 70% more likely to serve new categories.

Through this initiative, Amazon has invested in the following funds:

Collide Capital — Collide Capital is a Black-owned seed and pre-seed venture capital fund led by two founders under the age of 35: Aaron Samuels, who co-founded AfroTech, and Brian Hollins, who is a founding Board Member of BLCK VC. To date, Collide Capital has backed over 40 companies, of which 80%+ are led by Black, Latino, and/or female founders.

Elevate Future Fund — Elevate Future Fund, which is overseen by Energy Impact Partners (EIP), focuses on increasing funding to underrepresented founders working on solutions to accelerate the transition to a more sustainable and clean energy future. It will also make investments in companies that are led by underrepresented entrepreneurs, are empowering diverse talent, and/or are creating economic opportunity for distressed or disadvantaged communities. Elevate will also collaborate closely with Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund, which invests in emerging climate technology companies.

Share Ventures — Share Ventures is a Los Angeles-based venture fund and venture foundry focused on human performance. Share focuses on solving problems by creating and investing in innovative companies that unlock human potential, in categories including health tech, future of work, people tech, fintech, transportation, and purpose tech (companies facilitating impact and change).

Techstars Rising Stars Fund — With its first investments in 2022, the Rising Stars Fund is a pre-seed venture capital fund investing in underrepresented founders of color in the U.S. The fund is part of the Techstars investment business that provides access to capital, one-on-one mentorship, and customized programming for early-stage entrepreneurs.

Investors from the VC funds supported by Amazon have supported hundreds of underrepresented startup founders. With Amazon’s investments, these VC funds expect to back hundreds more companies and, in turn, help create more jobs and unlock economic growth in historically underserved communities.

“We are focused on addressing financial inclusion across the globe, and Collide Capital has been an investor in us from the early days. Collide has helped us to shape our vision and opened up access to future rounds of funding,” said the founder and CEO of fintech startup EMTECH, Carmelle Cadet. “EMTECH discovered a unique value proposition in rebuilding central banking infrastructure for the Web3 era. As a Black woman-founded tech company, having Collide getting excited about our vision was critical to our journey. We are better with them as partners, and I am excited to see how Amazon is supporting them to help even more entrepreneurs like me.”

“Our collaboration with the team at Amazon was born out of our shared passion for innovation in key areas that improve the human experience at scale. We are aligned with Amazon’s customer obsession and grateful to be learning and collaborating with them to build a portfolio of game changing companies,” said Hamet Watt, managing partner at Share Ventures.

Amazon Catalytic Capital is the latest in a series of Amazon-sponsored initiatives to boost and support early stage, underrepresented entrepreneurs. Amazon Web Services recently launched the AWS Impact Accelerator, investing $30 million in a series of programs designed to help high-potential, pre-seed startups led by underrepresented founders succeed. Amazon chose North American startups to be part of its 2022 Black Founders Build with Alexa cohort, each receiving a $100,000 Alexa Fund investment, as well as technology support. Additionally, in 2021, Amazon committed $150 million to its Black Business Accelerator, an initiative to help Black business owners succeed as sellers in Amazon’s stores.

3021,Amazon Literary Partnership Announces 2022 Grant Recipients,,esgnews.com,https://esgnews.com/amazon-literary-partnership-announces-2022-grant-recipients/,"The Amazon Literary Partnership announced more than $1 million in funding to 74 nonprofits nationwide

Amazon Literary Partnership is committed to supporting writing programs and nonprofit literary organizations that amplify emerging writers and diversity in storytelling

The Amazon Literary Partnership announced more than $1 million in grant funding to 74 literary nonprofits across the U.S. A longtime champion of the written word, Amazon Literary Partnership’s funding supports groups that are working to empower diverse, marginalized, and underrepresented voices, helping writers to create, publish, learn, teach, experiment, and thrive in 2022 and beyond. Included in this year’s cohort are 10 first-time grant recipient organizations.

For the fourth time, the Amazon Literary Partnership has also awarded grants of $140,000 each to the Academy of American Poets and to the Community of Literary Magazines and Presses (CLMP), to be used to fund dozens of literary organizations supporting poetry groups and literary magazines. The Academy of American Poets and CLMP will announce the recipients of the Poetry Fund and Literary Magazine Fund grants at a later date.

“We’re extremely grateful to work with the Amazon Literary Partnership to support a diverse community of poetry organizations and publishers whose work sparks compassion and helps us imagine new ways forward,” said Jennifer Benka, president and executive director of the Academy of American Poets.

“CLMP is extremely grateful to the Amazon Literary Partnership for providing support to literary magazines, which, like all publishers, continue to face the ongoing challenges of supply chain disruptions and rising production costs, but with fewer resources,” said CLMP Executive Director Mary Gannon. “Essential to the publishing ecosystem, literary magazines have shown resilience and innovation, fueled by their commitment to writers and the transformative power of literature. They deserve all the support they can get.”

Guided by the mission of having a lasting impact on the literary community, the Amazon Literary Partnership grants have supported more than 160 organizations with $15 million in grant funding since 2009. The grants have assisted tens of thousands of writers in telling their stories, amplifying their work, and finding their audiences.

“It’s an honor to support these vital institutions that ceaselessly champion writers and their work,” said Al Woodworth, manager of the Amazon Literary Partnership. “At Amazon, we believe in the power of the written word to expand our thinking, advance our empathy, and change our world. We are grateful for the incredible work that these organizations do for writers and their readers, today and every day.”

The Amazon Literary Partnership 2022 grant recipients, including the Poetry Fund and Literary Magazine Fund recipients, represent 30 states and support more than 20 new organizations that help writers throughout the lifecycle of their publishing career—from youth writing programs and publishing opportunities to residency programs, festivals, and workshops to speaking events and award programs. Organizations like the Asian American Writers’ Workshop, Empowering Latino Futures, Hurston/Wright Foundation, Lambda Literary, and Torch Literary Arts are explicitly focused on supporting underrepresented, underserved, and marginalized literary voices.

“I cannot tell you what wonderful feedback we received from the Amazon Writers cohort/participants,” said Angela Flowers, executive director of Writers in the Schools (WITS) for Houston. “The work invigorated my staff members in a challenging year, and the authors who coached and led workshops were so open to mentoring these young creatives. We love this program so very much and appreciate the Amazon Literary Partnership for supporting this essential creative work.”

We are thrilled to again be awarded funding for The SpeakEasy Bookmobile through the Amazon Literary Partnership and are grateful for the opportunity this award presents to expand this initiative in the year ahead Paul Morris, executive director of House of SpeakEasy

“We are thrilled to again be awarded funding for The SpeakEasy Bookmobile through the Amazon Literary Partnership and are grateful for the opportunity this award presents to expand this initiative in the year ahead,” said Paul Morris, executive director of House of SpeakEasy. “For the last four years, this grant has provided critical support for our bookmobile operations, allowing us to give away new books regularly in book deserts throughout the five boroughs of New York and in the 18 cities we visited in 2019. During the height of the pandemic, increased funding from Amazon Literary Partnership helped us put free books, book bags, and school supplies into the hands of students and families hardest hit by COVID-19.”

For more than a decade, the Amazon Literary Partnership has been the sole funder of the National Book Foundation’s 5 Under 35 program. “We are so grateful for the generous support of the Amazon Literary Partnership, which allows us to celebrate five authors each year whose debut titles provide a first look at their exceptional talent as fiction writers,” said Ruth Dickey, executive director at the National Book Foundation. “It’s a joy to welcome the 5 Under 35 authors into the National Book Foundation family, champion their debuts, and connect readers everywhere with these wonderful new voices.”

“We are very thankful for the support received from the Amazon Literacy Partnership, as it represents a big step for our organization toward uplifting Latino author voices in literature,” said Kirk Whisler, president of Empowering Latino Futures. “For a long time, we lacked the resources to support in more meaningful ways our community of Latino authors, but now they are thankful for finally seeing their books displayed and being promoted in a directory that represents them.”

KDP’s Drink Well. Do Good. platform is anchored by four key pillars: Environment, Supply Chain, Health and Well-Being and People and Communities. Notable 2021 achievements highlighted in the newly published report include:

Reducing virgin plastic: KDP remains on track to achieve its goals of using 30% post-consumer recycled (PCR) content across its packaging portfolio and converting 100% of packaging to be recyclable or compostable by 2025. In 2021, KDP eliminated its use of approximately 57 million pounds of virgin plastic by incorporating recycled plastic into KDP beverage bottles, supporting 11% use of PCR content across the Company’s packaging portfolio, up from 2% the year prior. In addition, 92% of the Company’s packaging is now recyclable or compostable.

Supporting an engaged and inclusive culture: KDP continues to prioritize employee engagement and advancing a culture of inclusion. Almost 90% of employees participated in the Company’s employee engagement survey, with KDP’s overall engagement score increasing to 70% in 2021, up from 62% the prior year. After announcing new goals last year to increase female and people of color representation in director and above positions by 25% by 2025, the Company increased female representation in those levels to 28% in 2021, while people of color representation held steady at 17%. KDP’s eight Employee Resource Groups continue to educate and inspire KDP employees to drive a culture of inclusion.

Monique Oxender, Chief Sustainability Officer, said: “The bar for ESG performance continues to rise, and we’re embracing the challenges most relevant to our business, rather than letting them impede progress. We remain an agile company that focuses on where we can uniquely deliver the greatest impact, with long-term goals rooted in near-term action. I am proud of the substantial work of the entire KDP team to deliver results against our commitments and the collective progress we’ve made this year.”

3070,Amazon named top corporate giver in Puget Sound region,,esgnews.com,https://esgnews.com/amazon-named-top-corporate-giver-in-puget-sound-region/,"With contributions of more than $96 million to over 180 local organizations, Amazon is making an impact in the areas of affordable housing, education, and community infrastructure.

Amazon is the top corporate philanthropist in the Puget Sound region for 2021, according to the Puget Sound Business Journal. With more than $96 million donated to over 180 local organizations, Amazon’s contributions are addressing challenges in the community that it calls home. It’s the first time Amazon has topped the Business Journal’s list of corporate philanthropists.

“Amazon was born in Puget Sound and we are grateful to be part of this thriving community,” said Alice Shobe, global director of Amazon in the Community. “We partner with many civic leaders, community organizations, and other companies to address urgent needs, and we are committed to doing our part to improve our region for future generations. We have more work to do—especially to produce equitable outcomes—yet we are making progress together.”

Below are some the areas that Amazon focused on for charitable giving last year:

Investing in affordable housing

Low-income and minority families are disproportionately affected by an affordable housing shortage in the U.S., and we believe the private and public sectors can work together to address this challenge. Since launching the Amazon Housing Equity Fund in January 2021, Amazon has committed more than $344.3 million in loans and grants for the Puget Sound region to create and preserve 2,870 affordable homes.

Removing barriers to education and STEM

We’ve invested in a myriad of local organizations that are helping to make sure people of all backgrounds have access and are exposed to technical careers. The investments include a $3 million gift to Seattle University to support the school’s commitment to increase access to computer science and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics)education for women and underrepresented minorities, our $10 million donation to Code.org, and our $1 million grant to the Pacific Science Center in Seattle. We’ve also partnered with the Alliance for Education and Bellevue Lifespring to strengthen the Right Now Needs Fund, an initiative that helps students with immediate needs, such as access to warm clothes for the winter, food, shelter, and school supplies.

Unlocking key community infrastructure



In 2021, Amazon made important donations to continue building key community projects in Seattle and Bellevue. The donations include $5 million to the Friends of the Waterfront to build a new 20-acre waterfront park along Seattle’s central shoreline and $7.5 million to complete a bike and walking trail in Bellevue that will connect many communities in the Eastside.

Amazon announced plans to create more than 2,500 corporate and technology jobs over the coming years in multiple cities across Southern California. The company will expand its Tech Hubs in San Diego and the Los Angeles area, including Irvine and Santa Monica, as it seeks to recruit local talent and continue inventing and innovating on behalf of its customers. These latest investments come after Amazon opened more than 15 sites across Southern California and created more than 17,000 jobs statewide in 2021 alone.

“Communities across California have welcomed Amazon over the past decade and have seen firsthand how our investments can unlock new opportunities for their neighbors and local economies. We’ve created more than 170,000 jobs across the state and are committed to continue investing here,” said Holly Sullivan, Amazon’s vice president of worldwide economic development. “These 2,500 new jobs includeroles building cloud infrastructure, improving the Alexa experience,and designing cutting edge video games. They’re afantastic opportunity for Californians of all backgrounds to join Amazon and build a successful career.”

Amazon’s expansions in California will support various teams across the company, including retail, Amazon Games, Amazon Web Services, and operations. A variety of roles are already available, including software development engineers, game designers, and user experience designers, along with positions in human resources, finance, IT, and more.

“Economic development, especially job creation, is critical to our city’s growth. Amazon’s expansion of its tech hub in Irvine is a testament to the fantastic talent pool and high quality of life our city has to offer,” said Farrah Khan, mayor of Irvine. “Investments like Amazon’s act as a vote of confidence for Irvine and these 800 new corporate and tech roles will continue to unlock economic opportunity for our community.”

“Job creation and economic development is essential to a sustainable and vibrant city,” said San Diego City Councilmember Chris Cate. “I am excited to see how Amazon’s expanded presence in San Diego will drive new investments in our region and bring 700 new tech and corporate jobs, boosting economic growth for years to come.

Amazon is constantly innovating and creating new programs to provide candidates of all backgrounds and levels of experience the opportunity to join the company. Now, candidates from California can benefit from Amazon Returnship, an initiative to help professionals get back to work after they’ve lost or left their jobs—including people displaced by the impacts of COVID-19. People applying for a tech role can also use Amazon’s newest recruiting program, Best Fit, which uses a new technology that allows software engineers to apply once and be considered for thousands of jobs across hundreds of Amazon teams—including some roles they may not have even thought of.

Unlocking opportunity in Southern California

Beyond its hiring efforts, Amazon contributes millions of dollars and continues to partner with more than 100 organizations across Southern California, including the Children’s Hospital of Orange County, Orange County United Way, the San Diego LGBT Community Center, the San Ysidro Women’s Club, and the Surfrider Foundation.

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Amazon has donated transportation services to deliver more than 4 million meals on behalf of Los Angeles Regional Food Bank. The company also made philanthropic contributions to programs that provided small business relief, allowed for the expansion of online learning, supported food distribution programs, and created mobile COVID-19 testing and vaccine clinics. As the U.S. emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic, Amazon continues to build economic opportunity in the communities it calls home. In Southern California, Amazon has built workforce development partnerships with city and county agencies across the region to offer Californian workers the opportunity to learn new skills in emerging fields like robotics, advanced logistics, and cloud computing.

Amazon also supports local schools through Amazon Future Engineer, the company’s global philanthropic computer science education program designed to inspire and educate millions of students each year to try computer science and coding. The program supports close to 600 schools across California, including Los Angeles and San Diego schools, providing students with high-quality computer science curriculum, robotics clubs, and project-based learning.

Since 2010, Amazon has created more than 170,000 full- and part-time jobs in California and invested more than $81 billion across the state, including infrastructure from fulfillment centers, Whole Foods Market locations, and three Tech Hubs. These investments have contributed an additional $80 billion to the California economy and support 259,000 indirect jobs—in addition to the employees the company directly employs—in industries like construction, logistics, and professional services. Currently, more than 220,000 independent authors and small and medium-sized businesses in California are growing their businesses with Amazon.

Amazon has made a $2.2 million donation to support the immediate needs of thousands of students from underserved communities in the Puget Sound region through the Right Now Needs Fund. The Fund—created by Amazon in 2018 in partnership with the nonprofits Alliance for Education and Bellevue LifeSpring—helps address students’ basic and immediate needs like food, shelter, clothing, and school supplies so students arrive at school prepared to learn. The donation will support all 106 schools within the Seattle Public Schools district and all 29 schools in the Bellevue School District.



“Many local families in underserved communities are feeling the impact of surging food and housing prices, and they’re making tough sacrifices to meet their immediate needs. We are determined to help by funding meals, shelter, clothing, school supplies, and other basic needs so kids can be successful students,” said David Zapolsky, Amazon general counsel and senior vice president, and Alliance for Education board member. “The Right Now Needs Fund helps our nonprofit partners and schools quickly identify and eliminate barriers to learning for students across the Puget Sound region, and we’re committed to continue supporting their work as one piece of our broader efforts to help our neighbors throughout the region.”

Amazon’s donation includes $1.4 million to the Alliance for Education to help identify and close opportunity gaps for local students and families at all of the 106 schools within the Seattle Public Schools district. Since the Fund was created with the Alliance for Education in 2018, donations have supported more than 38,000 requests for student support, including helping to cover costs for rent and utilities, food, clothing, and other basic needs.



“Amazon has been a tremendous partner to our Seattle Public Schools school community,” said Dr. Brent Jones, superintendent of Seattle Public Schools. “Throughout the life of our collaboration, they have demonstrated time and again that they are committed to expanding resources and providing immediate and tangible solutions for Seattle Public Schools students and families. We extend our gratitude and heartfelt thanks to Amazon and look forward to an even greater partnership in the future.”



Amazon also donated $700,000 in cash and $150,000 in Amazon Gift Cards to Bellevue LifeSpring to support all 29 schools in the Bellevue School District. Bellevue LifeSpring supports nearly 4,000 underserved students enrolled in the Bellevue School District and their families. Since the Fund was created with Bellevue LifeSpring in 2020, there have been more than 15,000 instances of student support, including issuing more than 5,400 food vouchers for students, ensuring 178 students remained in their homes, and providing clothing for 666 students.



“Our colleagues are working with students and families during these incredibly tough times, and many of the families need support from the Right Now Needs Fund,” said Julie Bronson, family engagement and preschool coordinator at the Bellevue School District. “The challenges are wide-ranging, from food and clothing needs to help with housing while facing financial challenges and other emergencies. We are very grateful for the support from Amazon and our partnership with both the Amazon and Bellevue LifeSpring teams because it ensures a quick response so that no child goes without basic supports that we all deserve.”



School-based staff within the districts work with students and families to identify needs and submit requests for financial assistance through their respective nonprofit partner. In addition, any school community member can request assistance if they notice a specific student need. To date, every school within Seattle Public Schools and the Bellevue School District has used the Right Now Need Fund to help students.



Since launching the first Right Now Needs Fund in Seattle in 2018, Amazon has donated more than $8 million to provide support across all 106 schools within Seattle Public Schools and all 29 schools in the Bellevue School District. Combined, the donations have supported more than 55,000 requests for support—from clothing to hygiene products to school supplies— for students and their families.



Additional donations from Amazon:

9,000 laptops and devices to Seattle Public Schools for remote learning.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) re/Start is starting new cohorts in 10 cities this summer, including launching for the first time in Oakland, California; Phoenix, Arizona; and Charlotte, North Carolina. AWS re/Start is a 12-week, full-time, classroom-based skills development and job training program that reskills learners for careers in the cloud and connects them to potential employers. The mission of the program is to build local talent by providing cloud skills development and opportunities to unemployed or underemployed individuals.

“Through the AWS re/Start program, I learned different programming languages and other skills needed to prepare for the exam. I learned the skills needed to earn my first AWS Certification.” Ana Rodriguez, AWS re/Start graduate

New AWS re/Start cohorts will also start in seven established locations—San Francisco, Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, New York, Boston, and Chicago. This year, AWS re/Start has launched in 19 U.S. cities, bringing our overall AWS re/Start U.S. footprint to 23 locations.

See related article: Amazon provides ‘Right Now Needs’ to students and families

Maureen Lonergan, VP of AWS Training and Certification, said, “Global digitization and the ‘Great Reshuffle’ are two powerful forces driving tremendous demand for individuals with cloud skills. An important way we’re helping bridge that gap is by making skills training accessible and widely available through the expansion of AWS re/Start in the U.S. This is a change-your-life program that helps individuals with few or no tech skills pivot into entry-level cloud computing roles. But we don’t stop there—we actively seek to connect learners into jobs with local employers in their local communities.”

Maureen Lonergan, VP of AWS Training and Certification

AWS re/Start graduates come from all walks of life. The program is focused on individuals from underrepresented communities, military veterans and their spouses, and those who have lost their jobs due to outdated skills. AWS re/Start works with local collaborating organizations to deliver the program around the world. These organizations share our mission of building a diverse global pipeline of entry-level talent.

New career paths

The AWS re/Start program prepares individuals with little or no technology experience to pursue entry-level cloud computing careers. Through real-world, scenario-based exercises, labs, and coursework, students build a range of skills in a number of technology areas, including Linux, Python, networking, security, and relational databases.

For instance, when Ana Rodriguez, a Bostonian originally from Colombia, lost her university administrative assistant job due to the pandemic, she knew she wanted to make a career change. She realized that she never wanted to find herself out of a job again, so she looked for tech-training opportunities. “I wanted to gain skills that would allow me to work from anywhere,” said Rodriguez.

Ana Rodriguez, AWS re/Start graduate

While researching organizations in the area that would offer free training, she learned about a local AWS re/Start cohort delivered in conjunction with the workforce nonprofit Per Scholas. “This program truly changed my life,” said Rodriguez. “Through the AWS re/Start program, I learned different programming languages and other skills needed to prepare for the exam. I learned the skills needed to earn my first AWS Certification.”

The AWS re/Start program is part of Amazon’s commitment to provide free cloud computing skills training to 29 million people around the world by 2025. The training is designed to meet a wide variety of schedules and learning goals. Learn more about our workforce programs for the public and get started today.

Skills and professional development opportunities

AWS re/Start emphasizes the development of professional skills, including effective communication and collaboration. The program provides learners with resume and interview coaching to prepare them for employer meetings and interviews. It also connects up to 90% of graduates with job interview opportunities.

Rodriguez appreciated her instructors’ support. “They helped us update our resumes and LinkedIn profiles. They even helped us prepare for conversations with potential employers. They set us up to succeed,” she said.

Even before Rodriguez graduated, she secured several interview opportunities for technology companies in Boston. She now works full-time at Numerated Growth Technologies, a fintech company based in Boston. “In my new, full-time role as an IT generalist, I’m using the concepts I gained from the re/Start program,” said Rodriguez. “And I have plans to learn more. I’m currently taking training to prepare for the AWS Certified SysOps Administrator – Associate Certification.”

Organizational benefits

Across various industries, AWS re/Start graduates have been hired to fill entry-level, in-demand cloud roles in operations, site reliability, and infrastructure support at organizations including Accenture, Capgemini, Financial Times, and Sony PlayStation. Employers who have hired AWS re/Start alumni report that our graduates are able to immediately put their skills to work.

“AWS re/Start is preparing a diverse pool of individuals to fill a wide range of in-demand roles,” said Kevin Kelly, director of cloud career training programs at AWS. “With hands-on experience in the AWS Cloud, AWS re/Start graduates have the skills and knowledge they need to add value.”

Six designers leverage SHEIN’s preferred material library to launch new sustainability-minded collections

SHEIN, a global, integrated fashion and lifestyle marketplace, announced that for the first time designers from the SHEIN X Designer Incubator Program have released collections under evoluSHEIN by Design, SHEIN’s product initiative aimed at accelerating the use of preferred materials and scaling responsible manufacturing processes.

Each of the six U.S.-based SHEIN X designers launching these new collections – Alexandria Carroll, Anke Wonder, Farah Naz, Jacqueline City, Lauren Flagg, and Lillian Butterworth – were handpicked based on their passion for sustainable fashion. Customers can shop their new pieces here.

“As a fashion company, our products are the biggest opportunity for impact, so we launched our evoluSHEIN by Design initiative to promote sustainable product development across SHEIN,” said Caitrin Watson, SHEIN’s director of sustainability. “The six designers launching collections today are already independently incorporating sustainability into their personal brands and have expressed that using these lower-impact materials is really important to them moving forward. We’re excited to open this up to our SHEIN X designers and beyond, and to hopefully inspire the next generation of sustainability-conscious fashion creators.”

To meet the evoluSHEIN by Design standard, garments must consist of at least 30% preferred materials, like recycled polyester, forest-safe viscose, and rescued deadstock, and be manufactured by suppliers that have achieved high social and environmental compliance verification through third-party audits. All pieces are also produced using SHEIN’s small-batch, on-demand production model and shipped in packaging made with recycled content.

“We’re sending out a message about how we’re trying to be more sustainable, how we’re trying to get people more involved with using sustainable fabrics and shopping sustainable clothing to help us cut down the waste,” said Flagg, the designer behind SHEIN X Obviously Vintage. “This is the route that we want to go with fashion.”

The SHEIN X Designer Incubator Program empowers creativity by guiding independent fashion designers and artists through the process that brings their ideas to life – from product development to manufacturing, to marketing and supply chain logistics. Since its launch, nearly 3,000 designers and artists from around the world have leveraged SHEIN’s industry-leading, on-demand production to launch more than 25,000 original creations to SHEIN’s global audiences. In September 2023, SHEIN announced it will invest an additional $50 million in the SHEIN X program over five years, bringing the company’s total investment to $105 million through 2028.

As part of Nestlé’s 2050 net zero roadmap and its work to spark regenerative agriculture, the company tests many new, innovative ideas. Those that prove effective and scalable are rolled out more broadly. In the UK, Nestlé is launching a pilot to assess whether cocoa shells from a confectionery site in York can be used to create a low-carbon fertilizer.

The two-year trial is designed to evaluate the fertilizer’s performance on crop production, soil health and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. If successful, up to 7 000 tonnes of low-carbon fertilizer could be produced and offered to farmers in Nestlé’s UK wheat supply chain. This amount of fertilizer equates to around 25% of Nestlé UK’s total fertilizer use for wheat.

The production and use of conventional fertilizer accounts for approximately 5% of global GHG emissions,1 and more than half of the carbon footprint of wheat grown in the UK is related to fertilizer use.

Recycling valuable nutrients from waste streams within the food system provides a promising opportunity to create a lower emissions supply chain. Scaling up low carbon fertilizer production can provide farmers with a more sustainable product at a reliable price.

The cocoa shells are supplied by Cargill, which processes the cocoa at the York facility to become key ingredients in iconic products like KitKat and Aero. A trial volume of cocoa shell has been processed and pelletized by Swindon-based CCm Technologies.

“Farmers often find themselves to be among the first groups exposed to global issues, and these risks are then borne by the food system we all depend upon,” said Matt Ryan, Regeneration Lead at Nestle UK & Ireland. “We have to find ways to build more resilience into the system and optimizing our use of natural resources is a critical part of this.”

“This project is a small, but very meaningful step towards a net zero future, where farmers, local enterprises, and nature all stand to benefit,” added Ryan.

The trials, which were designed and are being overseen by York-based Fera Science Ltd, are currently taking place on arable farms in Suffolk and Northamptonshire.

Richard Ling, farm manager at Rookery Farm, Wortham in Norfolk, who supplies wheat to Nestlé Purina, said: “We have now finished harvesting, and we’ve successfully grown a winter wheat crop using this new fertilizer.

3523,Amazon Commits $10.6 Million to Create 130 Affordable Homes and Expand Social Services in Nashville,,esgnews.com,https://esgnews.com/amazon-commits-10-6-million-to-create-130-affordable-homes-and-expand-social-services-in-nashville/,"The company announced new investments in Nashville from the Amazon Housing Equity Fund to help build and renovate more than 130 local homes, including a mixed-income development, and fund supportive and substance abuse recovery services

Over the past two years, Amazon has committed more than $94 million to affordable housing projects in Nashville—including affordable housing development near high-traffic transit sites, and an accelerator program to increase the number of real estate developers of color who focus on affordable housing

Amazon announced that it will invest a total of $10.6 million to help build and renovate more than 130 affordable homes in partnership with the Metropolitan Development and Housing Agency (MDHA), and support the social work of the local nonprofit CrossBridge Inc. This commitment is part of the Amazon Housing Equity Fund, a more than $2 billion commitment to create and preserve 20,000 affordable homes for individuals and families earning moderate-to-low incomes in Nashville, Washington state’s Puget Sound region, and the Arlington, Virginia, region.

“We’ve already hired more than 2,500 people at our Nashville office, and we’re continuing to invest and create jobs across the city. We also know that the city’s growth, the impacts of the pandemic, and various other factors affect the availability of affordable housing, and we want to do our part to help. As one important piece of that, we’re proud to be partnering with MDHA and CrossBridge to bring new housing to residents,” said Michelle Gaskin Brown, Amazon’s Nashville manager of public policy. “These new developments will provide affordable housing, social services support, and convenient access to public transportation to hundreds of families and individuals in the city. We look forward to continuing our investment in Nashville and helping to create and preserve affordable homes so everyone has the opportunity to live, work, and thrive here.”

Amazon’s commitment to MDHA consists of a $7.1 million low-rate loan to support the construction of Cherry Oak Apartments, a mixed-income residential development featuring 96 apartments, including 53 affordable homes in the Cayce Place neighborhood in East Nashville. Cherry Oak Apartments will provide housing in proximity to high-quality transit, employment centers, and parks. Families living in the affordable units at Cherry Oak Apartments will have guaranteed affordability at or below 80% of area medium income (AMI) for 99 years.

“Cherry Oak Apartments is one of many new residential developments at Cayce Place as we move forward with transforming our largest subsidized housing property into a mixed-income community,” said MDHA Executive Director Dr. Troy D. White. “We are grateful to receive Amazon’s first major investment for affordable housing in Nashville, and we hope this is just the start of a successful partnership.”

Additionally, Amazon is providing a $3.5 million grant to CrossBridge, a Nashville nonprofit that provides housing and supportive services to adults overcoming addiction. The grant will support CrossBridge’s housing projects on Lindsley Avenue in the Rolling Hill Mill neighborhood. CrossBridge owns an entire city block, where the organization is completing a new 50-unit building and renovating an existing 24-unit building into a 34-unit building. The grant will allow CrossBridge to complete its projects, operate at affordable rents, and expand services. CrossBridge will also provide tenants with mental health counseling, addiction support, workforce reentry support, and other services.

Supportive housing, which helps people with substance use disorders, is the most resource-intensive type of housing. The rents are extremely low and service requirements are high, making it necessary to provide long-term subsidies. The 84 CrossBridge units this funding supports will add to the most difficult to finance stock of permanent supportive housing in Nashville.

“CrossBridge provides effective solutions to end destructive cycles,” said Tina Mitchell, president-executive director of CrossBridge. “Through our Restoration House Program, we serve men and women struggling with substance use disorders. By offering high-quality, safe, and affordable housing within the context of a supportive community, we provide a reliable path to break the cycles of addiction, incarceration, and homelessness.” Bill Hart, CrossBridge vice president and general counsel, said, “This grant from the Amazon Housing Equity Fund will allow us to do so much more for those who have so little, resulting in transformed lives and a safer community.”

Over the past two years, Amazon has committed more than $94 million to affordable housing efforts in Nashville. In 2020, Amazon donated $2.25 million to local affordable housing nonprofit The Housing Fund—and followed up with another $1.5 million in 2021—to support housing residents in Nashville at risk of losing their homes. After launching the Housing Equity Fund in January 2021, Amazon announced a $75 million commitment to create 800 affordable homes near WeGo transit corridors. Most recently, Amazon launched an accelerator program in collaboration with the Urban League of Middle Tennessee, which offers professional development, mentorship, and early grant funding to emerging developers of color to help increase inclusive housing developments and community building.

3531,Amazon commits $100 million for affordable housing in western Washington near light rail stations,,esgnews.com,https://esgnews.com/amazon-commits-100-million-for-affordable-housing-in-western-washington-near-light-rail-stations/,"Sound Transit and Amazon are partnering together to create more than 1,000 units of affordable housing near light rail stations.

Amazon announced Wednesday the company is committing $100 million to help build 1,200 affordable housing units. The money is part of the company’s two-billion-dollar equity fund announced in January for the Puget Sound region, Arlington and Nashville.

“It’s really a huge benefit to [Sound Transit] as we only have about $20 million available for loan capital to help get and keep affordable housing within proximity to the neighborhoods where we’re building stations. Amazon just grew that to $120 million,” said Sound Transit Chief Executive Officer Peter Rogoff.

Rogoff said Sound Transit selected likely spots for housing in Federal Way, Lynnwood, Overlake Village, and near the University District Station.

Rogoff added many of the sites are being used as construction staging areas.

Data from King County shows a staggering need for affordable housing. To meet demand, the county needs 244,000 affordable housing units by 2040. Sound Transit hopes to have many of the 1,200 units open by 2024.

4381,"Lufthansa Joins Airbus Carbon Removal Program with 40,000 Ton Carbon Credit Purchase",,esgtoday.com,https://www.esgtoday.com/lufthansa-joins-airbus-carbon-removal-program-with-40000-ton-carbon-credit-purchase/,"Lufthansa Group announced an agreement with aerospace giant Airbus for the pre-purchase of 40,000 tons of carbon removal credits, to be delivered through the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere using Direct Air Capture (DAC) technology, as part of the Airbus Carbon Capture Offer (ACCO). The certificates, to be delivered over four years, will be available from 2026.

DAC technology, listed by the IEA as a key carbon removal option in the transition to a net-zero energy system, extracts CO2 directly from the atmosphere for use as a raw material or permanently removed when combined with storage. According to the landmark Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate change mitigation study released last year, scenarios that limit warming to 1.5°C include carbon dioxide removal methods scaling to billions of tons of removal annually over the coming decades, with DAC positioned to potentially account for a significant portion of the total.

In 2022, Airbus partnered with Direct Air Carbon Capture (DAC) company 1PointFive with an initial carbon credit purchase of 400,000 tons of carbon removals. 1PointFive, the carbon capture-focused subsidiary of energy giant Occidental (Oxy) is currently constructing what it expects to be the largest DAC facility in the world to date in the Texas Permian Basin, designed to capture 500,000 tonnes of CO2 per year when fully operational.

Nicolas Chrétien, Head of Environment & Sustainability at Airbus said:

“The Lufthansa Group was one of the very first aviation companies to work with Airbus to explore the potential of direct air carbon capture and storage solutions. As the aviation industry moves towards net zero CO2-emissions by 2050, carbon removal will play an important role in addressing remaining emissions.”

Lufthansa has set a target to achieve a neutral CO2 balance by 2050, and an ambition to halve its net CO2 emissions by 2030, compared to 2019. While the company’s climate initiatives focus primarily on emissions reductions, such as through scaling the use of sustainable aviation fuel, the company said that it views carbon removal solutions as “a complementary instrument in its sustainability strategy.” Lufthansa also noted that DAC can contribute to the development of SAF, with solutions such as Power-to-Liquid or Sun-to-Liquid technologies requiring the utilization of captured carbon.

Caroline Drischel, Head of Corporate Responsibility at the Lufthansa Group said:",esg_company_news,2023-12-07 15:46:01+00:00,2025-03-31 15:23:04.288998,"['Lufthansa Group', 'Airbus', 'D', 'ACC', 'DAC', 'IEA', 'Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change', 'IPCC', 'DAC', 'Airbus', 'Direct Air Carbon Capture', 'DAC', '1PointFive', '1PointFive', 'Occidental', 'Oxy', 'DAC', 'Environment & Sustainability', 'Airbus', 'Lufthansa Group', 'Airbus', 'Lu', 'SA', 'Power', 'Sun']",Lufthansa,2023.0,lufthansa,1.0
4530,Nestlé Pilots Project to Produce Low Carbon Fertilizer from Food Waste Streams,,esgtoday.com,https://www.esgtoday.com/nestle-pilots-project-to-produce-low-carbon-fertilizer-from-food-waste-streams/,"Food and beverage giant Nestlé announced today the launch of a new pilot project aimed at producing low carbon fertilizer using cocoa shells, and addressing a major source of agricultural greenhouse gas emissions.

Agriculture has emerged as a major focus area for climate action, as the sector accounts for a significant proportion of GHG emissions, and is among the most difficult areas to address climate impact. The sector contributes a significant proportion of the climate impact of the food and beverage sector, which in turn accounts for approximately a third of global GHG emissions.

Under the new UK-based project, Nestlé, one the world’s largest corporate cocoa consumers, will assess whether cocoa shells from a confectionery site in York can be used to create a low-carbon fertilizer. The two-year trial will evaluate the fertilizer’s performance on crop production, soil health and GHG emissions. If the project is successful, the company said that up to 7,000 tonnes of low-carbon fertilizer, roughly 25% the total used for the company’s UK wheat production, could be produced and offered to farmers in its UK wheat supply chain.

Nestlé announced a commitment in 2019 to achieve net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050, and in 2020 the company published its “time bound plan” to reach its climate goals, which also include targets to achieve a 20% emissions reduction by 2025 and 50% by 2030.

95% of Nestlé’s GHG emissions come from the company’s value chain, including around two-thirds from sourcing ingredients, and only around 5% from its direct operations. One of the company’s key emissions reduction initiatives includes advancing regenerative agriculture and farming practices, such as improving soil health, integrating trees into livestock foraging areas, switching to organic fertilizers and increasing the ability of farmland to store carbon.

In addition to heling the company reach its climate goals, Nestlé said that increasing production of low carbon fertilizer can also provide farmers with a more sustainable product at a reliable price.

4576,Lufthansa Signs Deal for Sustainable Aviation Fuel Made from Biogenic Residue,,esgtoday.com,https://www.esgtoday.com/lufthansa-signs-deal-for-sustainable-aviation-fuel-made-from-biogenic-residue/,"Lufthansa Group and chemical solutions company HCS Group announced today a new agreement for the production and supply of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) beginning in 2026, from a planned new 60,000 metric tonne per year biogenic SAF facility.

The companies have signed a Letter of Intent (LoI) for the HCS Group to supply Lufthansa with SAF produced using Alcohol -to-Jet (AtJ) technology, which converts alcohols derived from residues from agriculture and forestry into an alternative jet fuel blendstock.

The SAF will be produced at the Haltermann Carless site in Speyer, Germany, with initial production volume estimated at 60,000 metric tons per year, anticipated to be the first large-scale producer of biogenic SAF in Germany.

Sustainable aviation fuel is seen as one of the key tools to help decarbonize the aviation industry, which currently accounts for 2-3% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

Demand for SAF is likely to rise dramatically over the next few years, as airlines turn to the technology as one of the key solutions to hit their climate goals, and as governments begin to mandate increased SAF use to achieve their own decarbonization ambitions. In May, for example, lawmakers at the European Parliament and EU Council announced an agreement on new rules requiring a minimum SAF share of fuel at EU airports, rising to 70% by 2050.

According to Lufthansa, the agreement underpins its goals to drive the market and ramp use of sustainable aviation fuels. The company has set a target to achieve a neutral CO2 balance by 2050, and an ambition to halve its net CO2 emissions by 2030, compared to 2019.

4590,UK Court Rejects Attempt to Revive Climate Lawsuit Against Shell Directors,,esgtoday.com,https://www.esgtoday.com/uk-court-rejects-attempt-to-revive-climate-lawsuit-against-shell-directors/,"The UK High Court has rejected an attempt by environmental law organization ClientEarth to overturn the dismissal of its climate-focused legal action against the board of directors of energy giant Shell, with the ruling by Mr Justice Trower stating that ClientEarth has not “has made out a prima facie case that the Directors are in breach of their duties.”

ClientEarth said that it was disappointed by the ruling, and that it plans to appeal the dismissal.

ClientEarth launched its lawsuit in February, arguing that Shell’s energy transition strategy was flawed, putting shareholder value at risk, and asked the court to order the board to strengthen the company’s climate plans. The suit was the first of its kind seeking to hold corporate directors personally accountable to prepare for the energy transition.

The legal action claimed that the Directors’ duties to promote the success of the company and to exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence included several climate-related duties, including adopting strategies likely to meet the company’s targets to mitigate climate risk.

The suit was dismissed in May, however, with Trower’s decision agreeing with an argument by Shell that the apparent incidental duties were vague, and against principles that require directors to determine the weight to attach to the factors they consider.

In an oral hearing earlier this month, ClientEarth asked the judge to reconsider the dismissal of the claim, but the request was denied in today’s decision.

In his decision, the judge stated that ClientEarth’s arguments make clear that the organization “seek(s) to impose specific obligations on the Directors as to how the management of Shell’s business and affairs should be conducted.”

The judge also pointed out in the May ruling that ClientEarth’s very small stake in Shell, holding only 27 shares, “gives rise to a very clear inference that its real interest is not in how best to promote the success of Shell for the benefit of its members as a whole,” and that while ClientEarth’s contention that the board’s acceptance of climate risk as a serious risk to the business creates specific duties for the board, “I still think that their formulation is inconsistent with the well-established principle that it is for directors themselves to determine (acting in good faith) how best to promote the success of a company for the benefit of its members as a whole.”

In a statement released following the decision, a Shell spokesperson said:

“This is the right outcome – the court has reaffirmed its decision that this claim is fundamentally flawed and has, once again, dismissed it. “We believe our Directors have always complied with their duties and acted in the company’s best interest. This claim entirely ignores how directors of a business as large and complex as Shell must balance a range of competing considerations.”

The judge’s decision also pointed out that ClientEarth holds only 27 shares in Shell, giving substance to the company’s argument that “ClientEarth’s motivation is driven by something quite different from a balanced consideration as to how best to enforce the multifarious factors which the Directors are bound to take into account when assessing what is in the best interests of Shell.”

In statement following the ruling, ClientEarth senior lawyer Paul Benson said:

“We are disappointed that the Judge has declined to reconsider his decision. The hearing was the first step towards appeal, which we will now pursue. “The Court has accepted that climate change poses significant and foreseeable risks to Shell. We firmly stand behind our claim that the Board is currently neglecting to address those risks adequately, to the detriment of its shareholders.”

Benson added:",esg_company_news,2023-07-24 13:05:12+00:00,2025-03-31 15:28:13.737585,"['UK High Court', 'C', '##lientEarth', 'Shell', 'ClientEarth', 'ClientEarth', 'ClientEarth', 'Shell', '##row', 'Shell', 'C', '##lientEarth', 'ClientEarth', 'Directors', 'Shell', 'C', '##lientEarth', 'Shell', 'Shell', 'C']",Shell,2023.0,shell,1.0
4665,"UK Bans Shell, Petronas, Repsol Ads in Greenwashing Crackdown",,esgtoday.com,https://www.esgtoday.com/uk-bans-shell-petronas-repsol-ads-in-greenwashing-crackdown/,"UK ad regulator the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) issued a series of rulings on Wednesday banning several ads from major energy companies Shell, Petronas and Repsol highlighting the companies’ clean energy initiatives, with findings that the ads would likely to mislead consumers on the companies’ or their products overall environmental impact.

The ads included a poster, a TV ad, and a YouTube ad for Shell, a TV ad for Petronas, and an online display ad for Repsol. Shell’s ads included claims that 78,000 homes in the UK Southwest and 1.4 million UK households use 100% renewable electricity from Shell or Shell Energy, with taglines such as “The UK is READY for Cleaner Energy,” the Repsol ad said that the company “developing biofuels and synthetic fuels to achieve net zero emissions,” while Petronas’ ad stated that the company “started connecting the dots, to become a progressive energy and solutions partner,” after acknowledging that it had become part of “nature’s problem,” and included text on screen reading “Net Zero 2050.”

In each case, the ASA ruled that the ads breached codes regarding misleading advertising and environmental claims and must not appear again in their current forms. For example, while Shell argued that the ads were intended to raise awareness of and increase demand for its lower emissions products and that consumers already associated the company with sales of fossil fuel products, the ASA ruling said that the ads “gave the overall impression that a significant proportion of Shell’s business comprised lower-carbon energy products, further information about the proportion of Shell’s overall business model that comprised lower-carbon energy products was material information that should have been included.”

The ASA added:

“Because the ads did not include such information, we concluded that they omitted material information and were likely to mislead.”

Similarly, the regulator said that the Petronas ad omitted material information on the extent of the company’s continuing contribution to greenhouse gas emissions, while the Repsol ad’s claim that “we are developing biofuels and synthetic fuels to achieve net zero emissions” lacked context that the fuels would not achieve net zero emissions as a single measure.

Following the release of the rulings, ASA Director of Communications Donna Castle said:

“Today were publishing three important rulings about ‘green’ or environmental claims. We’ve upheld complaints against Shell, Petronas, and Repsol, for running ads or ad campaigns that made misleading claims about reducing their carbon emissions or promoting green energy.”

As part of a wider piece of work on environmental claims in the Energy sector, today we published three rulings on well-known energy companies that made misleading claims about reducing their carbon emissions or promoting green energy. https://t.co/dbGYsX8oPm pic.twitter.com/HSEid8cA34 — ASA (@ASA_UK) June 7, 2023

The regulator did not uphold challenges to Shell’s claim about providing renewable electricity to homes, as Shell had substantiated the claims.

The rulings come as the regulator has increased its focus lately on environmental claims made in ads. Earlier this year, the ASA ruled that an ad campaign by Lufthansa gave a misleading impression of the company’s environmental impact, and last year, the ASA ruled that ads by HSBC highlighting the bank’s climate-focused actions were misleading, as they omitted information about HSBC’s continued financing activities for emissions-intensive industries and businesses. Earlier this year, the ASA released guidance for advertisers making environmental sustainability claims to consumers, and said that it will be taking action to address “entirely unqualified” claims of carbon neutrality or net zero.

In a statement provided to ESG Today, a Shell spokesperson said that the company strongly disagreed with the decision, adding that it “could slow the UK’s drive towards renewable energy,” and that the company was “concerned by this short-sighted decision.”

The spokesperson said:

“People are already well aware that Shell produces the oil and gas they depend on today. When customers fill up at our petrol stations across the UK, it’s under the instantly recognisable Shell logo. “But what many people don’t know is we’re also investing heavily in low- and zero-carbon energy, including building one of the UK’s largest public networks of EV charge points. No energy transition can be successful if people are not aware of the alternatives available to them.”

Adfree Cities brought the challenges against Shell and Repsol. Following the release of the rulings, Veronica Wignall, co-director of Adfree Cities, said:

“The world’s biggest polluters will not be permitted to advertise that they are ‘green’ while they build new pipelines, refineries and rigs – but this doesn’t go far enough. Shell and other fossil fuel expanders should not be permitted to advertise at all, given their historic and ongoing role in wrecking the planet.”

Update:

Following the publication of our article, ESG Today received statements from spokespeople at Petronas and Repsol. The statements can be found below:

Petronas said:

PETRONAS disagrees that the advertisement is misleading and overstated. PETRONAS is currently undertaking sustainability efforts including in respect of its existing energy business, towards a cleaner energy future. PETRONAS remains committed towards its lower-carbon ambitions spelt out in its Net Zero Carbon Emissions by 2050 (NZCE50) Pathway. These efforts align with its role as Malaysia’s national oil company to add value to the country’s hydrocarbon resources and support economic value creation with a reliable supply of energy, while paving the way to a lower-carbon future in a just and sustainable manner.

4782,Allbirds Unveils First-Ever Zero Carbon Footprint Shoe,,esgtoday.com,https://www.esgtoday.com/allbirds-unveils-first-ever-zero-carbon-shoe/,"San Franciso-based lifestyle brand Allbirds announced the creation of “M0.0NSHOT,” described by the company as the world’s first net zero carbon shoe, achieved without relying on offsets.

According to Allbirds, the new shoe has a carbon footprint of 0 kg CO2e, compared to an industry average 14kg.

The company said that the shoe’s development was the culmination of years of work, including the creation in 2018 of a carbon negative material, SweetFoam, in 2018, which informed the new foam for M0.0NSHOT, and a 2021 partnership with Adidas on a low-carbon shoe, Adizero x Allbirds.

The new shoe includes a carbon-negative regenerative merino wool upper sourced from New Zealand regenerative farming location Lake Hawea Station, a new superlight foam with 80% bio content, and bioplastic eyelets made from microorganisms that convert methane into plastic-like polymers. Packaging for the product is made from sugarcane-derived, carbon-negative Green PE, and transportation for the product will use biofuel powered ocean shipping and electric trucking.

Tim Brown, co-founder and co-CEO of Allbirds, said:

“M0.0NSHOT isn’t a silver bullet for the climate crisis — it’s a proof-point that, when we take sustainability seriously, and are laser focused on carbon reduction, we can make incredible breakthroughs.”

4795,Shell Says Climate Lawsuits Won’t Help Energy Transition,,esgtoday.com,https://www.esgtoday.com/shell-says-climate-lawsuits-wont-help-energy-transition/,"Faced with growing pressure from climate-focused lawsuits, energy giant Shell said in its newly released “Energy Transition Progress Report 2022” that litigation won’t help facilitate the transition of the world’s energy system to reach global climate goals.

The company also said that it does not plan to set interim Scope 3 emissions targets, which would include emissions from the use of its energy products, such as oil and gas, as this would hurt the company financially and not contribute to mitigating global warming.

The report follows a series of recent legal actions against Shell, including a lawsuit in the UK against the company’s board of directors announced last month by environmental law organization ClientEarth, arguing that the company’s “flawed” energy transition strategy puts shareholder value at risk, and asking the court to order the board to strengthen the company’s climate plans, as well as a complaint filed also last month to the SEC by advocacy group Global Witness accusing the company of greenwashing by misleading investors about the amount of investment it is directing towards renewable energy.

In 2021, a case filed in a Dutch court resulted in an order for the company to slash emissions by 45% by 2030. In the ruling, the Dutch court judge said that Shell’s energy transition plan was “not concrete and is full of conditions.” Shell has appealed the decision, but said in its progress report that it is taking steps to comply with the ruling, and that its actions are consistent with the 2030 timeline.

Overall, Shell said that it is “involved in more than 20 such court cases worldwide.”

In the report, Shell said that it agrees that “there is an urgent need to change the world’s energy system,” adding that the company “is determined to play its part in helping to change the world’s energy system,” but argues that litigation does not facilitate the cooperation needed to effect the transition.

The company stated:

“We believe it is for governments to determine the right trade-offs for society and to put in place the policies that bring about fundamental changes in the way society consumes energy. Litigation does not enable the global cooperation required to change both supply and demand for energy, as well as the infrastructure supporting the use of energy.”

Scope 3 emissions, which accounts for the vast majority of energy companies’ carbon footprints, are a key focal point for some investor action, and for some of the litigation against the company. In the “Chair’s message” included in the report Shell Chairman Andrew Mackenzie said that “the Board has considered setting a Scope 3 absolute emissions target but has found it would be against the financial interests of our shareholders and would not help to mitigate global warming.”

Providing more detail later in the report, the company said that in order to implement a more ambitious Scope 3 target, the company would be required to reduce its sales of oil and gas products, and that in the absence of a change in customer demand, “would effectively mean handing over customers to competitors.”

The company added:

“This would materially affect Shell’s financial strength and limits its ability to generate value for shareholders. It would also reduce our ability to play an important role in the energy transition by working with customers to reduce their emissions.”

In 2020, Shell announced a commitment to achieve net zero in its operations by 2050, and in 2021, the company launched its “Powering Progress” strategy, detailing how it will achieve its target to be a net-zero energy business by 2050 across Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, with initiatives including investing in renewable and clean energy solutions.

The energy transition strategy was approved by shareholders in an advisory vote in 2021 with 89% supporting the plan. The following year, however, only 80% supported the progress report in implementing its transition strategy.

In the Chair’s message, Mackenzie said dialogue with shareholders indicated that some of the reasons for not supporting the 2021 progress included “societal pressure, potential media coverage, and expectations from investors in their funds.”

The company’s 2022 progress will be subject to an advisory vote at this year’s AGM, scheduled for May 23, and Shell said that investors will be able to vote on the strategy again in 2024.

4804,Advertising Watchdog says Lufthansa Ad Made Misleading Environmental Claims,,esgtoday.com,https://www.esgtoday.com/advertising-watchdog-says-lufthansa-ad-gave-misleading-environmental-claims/,"An ad campaign last year by Lufthansa “gave a misleading impression of the advertiser’s environmental impact,” according to UK advertising regulator the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) in a ruling released today.

Lufthansa was ordered to ensure that the basis of future environmental claims in its ads was made clear, and don’t give a misleading impression of the impact of traveling with the airline, with robust substantiation for the claims.

The ruling referred to posters for Lufthansa in June 2022 featuring a view of a plane from the front, with the bottom half represented by an image of the Earth, and a tagline that read “CONNECTING THE WORLD. PROTECTING ITS FUTURE.”

In response to the ASA’s challenge, Lufthansa said that the purpose of the ad, part of its “#MakeChangeFly” campaign, was to address the need to reduce the environmental impact of flying, and make consumers aware of the company’s efforts to achieve that goal, via a link to a website displayed on the ad to www.makechangefly.com. Lufthansa argued that the ad would not be understood as a promise about the company’s service or that it caused no environmental harm, and that it did not make any specific claims to that end.

In it’s ruling, however, while acknowledging that the ad’s text “was ambiguous and not clearly linked to the environment,” the ASA said that appearing with the image of the globe, it was likely to be interpreted by consumers as referring to “how Lufthansa’s approach to aviation was protecting the future of the world.”

Additionally, while the ASA noted that the campaign was based on the airline’s planned specific steps to hit climate goals, its claim that it was “protecting the future,” could be “understood by consumers to mean that Lufthansa had already taken significant mitigating steps to ensure that the net environmental impact of their business was not harmful.”

The ruling comes as the regulator has increased its focus lately on environmental claims made in ads. In October, the ASA ruled that ads by HSBC highlighting the bank’s climate-focused actions were misleading, as they omitted information about HSBC’s continued financing activities for emissions-intensive industries and businesses. Earlier this year, the ASA released guidance for advertisers making environmental sustainability claims to consumers, and said that it will be taking action to address “entirely unqualified” claims of carbon neutrality or net zero.",esg_company_news,2023-03-01 16:06:37+00:00,2025-03-31 15:33:41.273144,"['Lufthansa', 'Advertising Standards Authority', 'ASA', 'Lufthansa', 'Lufthansa', 'ASA', 'Lufthansa', '##Chang', '##Fly', '##ly', 'Lufthansa', 'ASA', 'Lufthansa', 'ASA', 'Lu', 'AS', 'H', 'AS']",Lufthansa,2023.0,lufthansa,1.0
4849,Shell Board of Directors Sued over “Flawed” Climate Strategy,,esgtoday.com,https://www.esgtoday.com/shell-board-of-directors-sued-over-flawed-climate-strategy/,"Environmental law organization ClientEarth announced today that it has launched legal action against the board of directors of energy giant Shell in the UK, arguing that the company’s “flawed” energy transition strategy puts shareholder value at risk, and asking the court to order the board to strengthen the company’s climate plans.

According to ClientEarth, the suit is the first of its kind to seek to hold corporate directors personally accountable to prepare for the energy transition.

In a statement provided to ESG Today, a Shell spokesperson said:

“We do not accept ClientEarth’s allegations. Our directors have complied with their legal duties and have, at all times, acted in the best interests of the company.”

In 2020, Shell announced a commitment to achieve net zero in its operations by 2050, and in 2021, the company launched its “Powering Progress” strategy, detailing how it will achieve its target to be a net-zero energy business by 2050 across Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, with initiatives including investing in renewable and clean energy solutions. The energy transition strategy was approved by shareholders in an advisory vote in 2021.

In a statement announcing the legal action, however, ClientEarth described the plan as “simply unreasonable,” arguing that the strategy fails to deliver sufficient emissions reductions to align with global climate goals, and continuing with fossil fuel production for decades, tying the company to investments that may become unprofitable amidst the global transition to cleaner energy sources. ClientEarth said that it is bringing the case as a shareholder in the company.

ClientEarth said:

“The future consequences of Shell’s flawed climate plans could cause the company’s value to plummet, costing jobs and running the risk of shareholders and investors losing significant amounts of money, including people’s pension funds.”

The suit marks the latest in a series of shareholder and legal challenges to face Shell over its energy transition strategy, including a complaint filed earlier this month to the SEC by advocacy group Global Witness accusing the company of greenwashing by misleading investors about the amount of investment it is directing towards renewable energy. In 2021, a case filed in a Dutch court resulted in an order for the company to slash emissions by 45% by 2030. In the ruling, the Dutch court judge said that Shell’s energy transition plan was “not concrete and is full of conditions.”

In its statement, ClientEarth said that Shell’s interim targets and strategy to become a net zero emission energy business by 2050 “simply don’t add up,” citing analyst research suggesting that the plans would only achieve a 5% net emissions reduction by 2030.

ClientEarth Senior Lawyer Paul Benson said:

“Shell is seriously exposed to the risks of climate change, yet its climate plan is fundamentally flawed. In failing to properly prepare the company for the net-zero transition, Shell’s Board is increasing the company’s vulnerability to climate risk, putting its long-term value of in jeopardy.”

Several institutional investors have announced support for the action by ClientEarth, including UK Government-backed pension scheme Nest, UK local government pension scheme London CIV, the Swedish Government pension fund AP3, Danske Bank Asset Management & Danica Pension in Denmark, and AP Pension in Sweden.

In a social media statement following the announcement, Mark Fawcett, Chief Investment Officer of Nest said, “we hope the whole energy industry sits up and takes notice.”

Fawcett added:

“Investors want to see action in line with the risk climate change presents and will challenge those who aren’t doing enough to transition their business.”

4861,Climate Group Accuses Shell of Greenwashing in Complaint to SEC,,esgtoday.com,https://www.esgtoday.com/climate-group-accuses-shell-of-greenwashing-in-complaint-to-sec/,"Climate and environmental sustainability advocacy group Global Witness announced today that it has submitted a complaint to the SEC, accusing energy giant Shell of greenwashing by misleading investors about the amount of investment it is directing towards renewable energy.

According to Global Witness, by lumping in some of its gas-related investments with its spending on renewables, Shell is misleading investors by inflating its overall investment in renewable sources of energy.

In a statement announcing the complaint, Global Witness said:

“Despite fossil fuel giant Shell claiming to spend 12% of its annual expenditure on “Renewables and Energy Solutions”, we found that in reality the company only spends 1.5% of its overall expenditure on solar and wind power generation. Alarmingly, it appears that a significant portion of Shell’s spending on “Renewables and Energy Solutions” actually goes to investments in climate-wrecking gas.”

In 2020, Shell announced a commitment to achieve net zero in its operations by 2050, and in 2021, the company launched its “Powering Progress” strategy, detailing how it will achieve its target to be a net-zero energy business by 2050 across Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, with initiatives including investing in renewable and clean energy solutions.

Even after launching the strategy, however, the company has found itself at the center of action by climate-focused organizations, including a case filed in a Dutch court resulting in an order for the company to slash emissions by 45% by 2030. In the 2021 ruling, the Dutch court judge said that Shell’s energy transition plan was “not concrete and is full of conditions.”

According to Shell’s Renewables and Energy Solutions webpage, the company “is working to provide more renewable and low-carbon energy options for customers through investments in wind, solar, electric vehicle charging, hydrogen, and more.” The company’s annual report outlines the activities comprising the unit, which include generating electricity through wind and solar, providing electricity storage, marketing and trading gas and power, selling gas and power to commercial, industrial and retail customers, providing electric vehicle charging services, and providing customers with digitally enabled solutions.

While the report says that Shell’s capital expenditures in the Renewables and Energy Solutions was $2.4 billion in 2021, Global Witness said in its complaint that it estimates that only $288 million was directed towards wind and solar power generation.

In its statement, the group said:

“Global Witness calls on the SEC to investigate Shell’s greenwashing of its fossil gas investments to determine if Shell violated relevant US securities laws, and if appropriate, to impose fines and to prohibit Shell from further violations.”

The company said that the strategy to reach its water positive target will consist of four key aspects including improving water efficiency, using sustainable water sources, returning water for community reuse and supporting water replenishment projects.

Adam Selipsky, CEO of AWS, said:

“Water scarcity is a major issue around the world and with today’s water positive announcement we are committing to do our part to help solve this rapidly growing challenge. In just a few years half of the world’s population is projected to live in water-stressed areas, so to ensure all people have access to water, we all need to innovate new ways to help conserve and reuse this precious resource. While we are proud of the progress we have made, we know there is more we can do.”

AWS outlined a series of water replenishment initiatives around the world, including supporting recently launched water, sanitation and hygiene-focused non-profit WaterAid projects in India, working in the UK with initiatives The Rivers Trust and Action for the River Kennet to create two wetlands on a tributary of the River Thames, and in the U.S., recharging 189 million liters of groundwater per year using winter water from the Cosumnes River in collaboration with conservation non-profit Freshwater Trust, and the Omochumne-Hartnell Water District.

The company also announced that in continued efforts to meet its water reuse and recycling target, it will report annually on its global water use efficiency (WUE) metric, which stood at 0.25 liters of water per kilowatt-hour in 2021.

The company stated that today’s announcement adds to Amazon’s recent $10 million commitment to Water.org’s Water & Climate Fund, which works to deliver climate-resilient water and sanitation solutions to 100 million people across Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

The new commitments include $50 million for Amazon to invest directly in climate tech companies run by women, with the funding being allocated from Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund, its venture investment program to back visionary companies developing products and services that facilitate the transition to a zero carbon economy.

Amazon launched the $2 billion Climate Pledge Fund in 2020, aiming to help Amazon and other companies achieve the goals outlined in The Climate Pledge, including reaching net zero carbon by 2040.

Kara Hurst, Vice President of Worldwide Sustainability at Amazon, said:

“As an important step in solving climate change, we must address the gender inequalities that persist in climate finance, and ensure female entrepreneurs have an equal seat at the table and access to the funding, networks, and technical support they need to scale climate solutions.”

Amazon will also commit $3 million and serve as a founding partner to USAID’s Climate Gender Equity Fund, a new climate finance facility designed to remove systemic market barriers that prevent women and girls from accessing climate finance. The globally-focused fund will provide grants for businesses, NGOs, accelerators, incubators, and grassroots organizations working on women-led climate solutions, and fund efforts to help women access the networks and technical skills they need to accelerate the development of their climate change technologies. USAID will match Amazon’s $3 million investment.

Amazon said it will work with Climate Pledge signatories and other companies to encourage additional support and corporate investment in this new fund.

5158,Amazon Buys Green Hydrogen to Power Transportation & Buildings,,esgtoday.com,https://www.esgtoday.com/amazon-announces-large-scale-green-hydrogen-supply-deal-to-power-transportation-buildings/,"Amazon announced an agreement with hydrogen and fuel cell solutions company Plug Power for the supply of nearly 11,000 tons per year of green hydrogen starting in 2025, sufficient to power 30,000 forklifts or 800 heavy-duty trucks for long-haul transport annually.

The announcement is the latest in a series of moves announced by Amazon over the past several years, aimed at achieving its goal to reach net zero emissions across its operations by 2040. The company has already emerged as the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy, and is on track to power 100% of company activities with renewables by 2025, and it has also announced significant investments to electrify its delivery fleet.

Hydrogen is viewed as one of the key building blocks of the transition to a cleaner energy future, particularly for sectors with difficult to abate emissions, in which renewable energy solutions such as wind or solar are less practical.

Around 90 million metric tons of hydrogen are produced annually, although the vast majority is extracted using fossil fuels, which create pollutants and GHG emissions. Significant investments are required to develop clean extraction processes, such as green hydrogen, which uses a renewable energy-powered electrolysis process to extract hydrogen from water.

Amazon said that large purchase agreements like the one announced today are expected to help foster the growth of green hydrogen, providing a signal to the industry to expand the hydrogen economy.

Kara Hurst, Vice President of Worldwide Sustainability at Amazon, said:

“Amazon is proud to be an early adopter of green hydrogen given its potential to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors like long-haul trucking, steel manufacturing, aviation, and ocean shipping. We are relentless in our pursuit to meet our Climate Pledge commitment to be net-zero carbon across our operations by 2040, and believe that scaling the supply and demand for green hydrogen, such as through this agreement with Plug Power, will play a key role in helping us achieve our goals.”

The electric vehicles were entered into service on Thursday in cities including Baltimore, Chicago, Dallas, Kansas City, Nashville, Phoenix, San Diego, Seattle, and St. Louis. Amazon and Rivian plan to have the custom EVs operating in more than 100 cities by the end of the year, and anticipate the U.S. fleet to reach 100,000 vehicles by 2030.

Amazon’s 2040 net zero goal forms part of the company’s commitment under the Climate Pledge, an initiative started by the company alongside climate change-focused organization Global Optimism, calling on companies to sign on to achieve net zero carbon across their businesses 10 years ahead of the Paris Accord’s 2050 target. Since founding the initiative in 2019, more than 300 companies have joined as signatories to the Pledge.

The order for 100,000 Rivian EVs was initially announced alongside the launch of the Climate Pledge in 2019, and the Rivian was one of the first investments made by the Climate Pledge Fund, Amazon’s venture investment program aimed at backing companies developing products and services that facilitate the transition to a zero carbon economy.

Amazon has invested over $1.3 billion in Rivian, and it’s stake is now worth more than $5 billion, although the value of its holdings in the company has declined from over $20 billion following Rivian’s November 2021 IPO.

Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon, said:

“Fighting the effects of climate change requires constant innovation and action, and Amazon is partnering with companies who share our passion for inventing new ways to minimize our impact on the environment. Rivian has been an excellent partner in that mission, and we’re excited to see our first custom electric delivery vehicles on the road.”

The new vehicles were designed and engineered in collaboration with Amazon, and include advanced technology and sustainability features such as sensor detection, highway, and traffic assist technology, enhanced driver visibility, access to routing, navigation, and driver support, as well as driver experience and workflow-focused features including automatic door locking and unlocking as the driver approaches or leaves the vehicle, and a powered bulkhead door.

5564,Starbucks Advances Plans to Eliminate Single Use Cups,,esgtoday.com,https://www.esgtoday.com/starbucks-advances-plans-to-eliminate-single-use-cups/,"Starbucks announced new plans to provide its customers globally with reusable cup options, as the coffee retail giant advances on its waste reduction initiatives to eliminate single-use cups.

The new plans were announced along with a series of sustainability-focused initiatives ahead of Starbucks’ annual shareholder meeting today, advancing the company’s progress towards its sustainability goals. Starbucks has committed to become a “resource positive” company, following strategies that include shifting away from single-use packaging, investing in regenerative agricultural practices, forest restoration, and water replenishment, promoting recycling and reuse of waste, and expanding plant-based menu options, among others. The company has set a series of 2030 sustainability targets under its resource positive strategy, including reducing operational and supply chain emissions by 50%, conservation or replenishment of 50% of water withdrawal for direct operations and coffee production, and a 50% reduction in waste sent to landfill from stores and manufacturing.

Starbucks President and CEO, Kevin Johnson said:

“We have a bold long-term sustainability vision and ambitious goals for 2030. Starbucks partners around the world are passionate about protecting our planet and are at the very center of driving the innovation that enables us to give more than we take from the planet.”

The new initiatives follow the announcement by Starbucks earlier this month of its first 100% reusable cup store at its SODO 8 Starbucks café located in its Seattle office, and the launch last year of the Borrow-a-Cup initiative at several Seattle-area test stores, enabling customers to order a beverage in a reusable cup, pay a $1 deposit, and then scan and return the cup at a return kiosk to receive the $1 credit in return. The company is now testing multiple Borrow-A-Cup and reusable operating models several markets around the world, including the US, UK, Japan, and Singapore, with plans to add additional countries in the year ahead.

Starbucks said that it aims to enable customers in the U.S. and Canada to use personal reusable cups for every visit, including café, drive-thru and mobile order and pay, and has set a 2025 goal for customers globally to have access to a reusable cup option for every visit.

Additional initiatives announced by the company include the launch of a new Partner Waste and Recycling App, designed to help partners navigate complex and unique store recycling guidelines, and a new pilot program with Volvo Cars to electrify driving route from Denver to the Starbucks Seattle headquarters, beginning with the installation of EV chargers at 15 Starbucks stores along the route.

The new test program follows the launch last year by Starbucks of the Borrow-a-Cup initiative at several Seattle-area test stores. The program enables customers to order a beverage in a reusable cup and pay a $1 deposit. Customers can then scan and return the cup at a participating store’s return kiosk, and scan their Starbucks App to receive a $1 credit to their Starbucks Rewards account. The returned cup is then professionally cleaned and sanitized and returned to circulation within 48 hours.

Borrow-a-Cup will now be a permanent feature at SODO 8, the Starbucks café located in the Starbucks Seattle office, enabling customers to participate in the program or bring their own cup.

Starbucks stated that the SODO 8 program is only a test, but will learn about customer habits and opinions, such as how quickly cups are returned, and whether customers enjoy drinking from the cup, among others. Borrow-a-Cup is still in its early stages and is currently being tested in a few Starbucks locations around the world.

Starbucks stated that its new test program forms part of its commitment to reducing single-use cup waste.

8357,Interface’s sustainability manager on circular interiors,,sustainabilitymag.com,https://sustainabilitymag.com/sustainability/interfaces-sustainability-manager-on-circular-interiors,"What are the benefits and challenges of carbon neutrality in manufacturing?

When an organisation strives to become truly carbon neutral, there are bound to be various challenges along its journey. Critically though, a business must take a holistic view of its processes – from the supply chain to manufacturing and also, the journey to the end-user. Every stage of the journey has an incremental impact, so you need to have a clear map of the full life cycle of a product.

In practice this can be challenging as some parts of the life cycle are easier to influence than others. If you’re going to upturn every one of your processes, then you need to get comfortable with being uncomfortable as you will inevitably uncover things that are trickier to ‘fix’ than others. There isn’t a ‘one size fits all’ approach to carbon reduction and the entire process is often long and complex.

In terms of benefits, the list is endless; when manufacturing becomes carbon neutral, the impact on the environment is huge. Manufacturing accounts for an estimated 16% of all carbon emissions in the UK, so the industry has a huge role to play in the push to Net Zero.

Looking at this from a commercial perspective - if you can demonstrate significant carbon reduction, your proposition as a partner is more attractive to customers as it helps all stakeholders work towards a shared goal of carbon neutrality.

How can companies like Interface decrease impact on the environment within their factories, products, and supply chain?

In our experience, to create real, measurable change, you need to be prepared to dedicate plenty of time and resources to carbon reduction. You also need to be prepared to fail – you won’t always succeed but you need to be prepared to step out of your comfort zone and try things.

Practically, reducing emissions across internal operations and outputs is naturally the focus and the priority, but it’s also important to consider the impact of your product once it is in your customers’ hands. This means supporting them through the full life cycle of your product – for example, Interface’s ReEntry™ Programme, is one way that we minimise the impact of our products on the environment, even after they’ve left our hands.

What advice do you have for companies looking to reduce their impact?

A good place to start is considering energy use - looking at where energy might be wasted, and for efficiencies and renewable options. The fact is, once you can measure it, you can manage it better.

As a manufacturer, our biggest carbon impact is in what we make – and designing our products differently offers the best potential in reducing our total environmental impact. Turning to recycled and bio-based materials has allowed us to significantly reduce the footprint of our products. For example, changing our backing from bitumen to our CQuestBio™ bio-composite reduced the overall footprint of our carpet tile portfolio in Europe by a third.

The most important thing to remember is that all decisions should be considered through a sustainability lens (no matter how big or small). If you try to isolate reducing emissions to one for example, just your factories, it won’t create the change required. You need to think about the impact of the company holistically and empower every employee to play a part in helping the business to achieve its sustainability goals.

Your ripple effect could be bigger than you think. Of course, your own operations are a natural place to start but that’s not the end of it - you also have the opportunity to influence suppliers and customers and innovate alongside them. By working together, you can have a bigger impact in cutting emissions, turning waste into opportunity, and protecting nature and biodiversity.

Carbon reduction is a journey, but it’s fine to start with a few small steps like energy efficiency, asking suppliers about embracing renewables, or looking to reduce waste. It’s no easy feat, but when you’re willing to take those first strides, you’re already making a move to becoming part of the solution, rather than the problem.

8387,IBM migrates Neste’s ERP in a transition to sustainable fuel,,sustainabilitymag.com,https://sustainabilitymag.com/supply-chain-sustainability/ibm-migrates-nestes-erp-in-a-transition-to-sustainable-fuel,"Marko Mäki-Ullakko, Head of Integrated ERP at Neste, has been heavily involved in delivering ongoing updates to the company’s ERP systems and processes, namely the deliverance of the SAP S/4HANA® solution. This cloud solution was chosen as a suitable cloud-based software for fast-growing businesses.

“On a process and data level, the supply chain for renewable products is quite different from that of the traditional oil business,” says Mäki-Ullakko. “It was in many ways a new kind of business, and we needed a new foundation to build it on.”

Mäki-Ullakko explains that the different fuel types altered more than the quantity of carbon emissions, but was a major transition point for its supply chain, which saw an operational shift that resulted in a new structure to the company’s data. The conventional means of supplying fuel no longer apply as the company relies on smaller deposits of materials like used cooking oil to make its products.

“With renewables, imagine individual tank trucks picking up small loads of used cooking oil at a restaurant and then moving to the next stop. It’s a completely different footprint, and it generates entirely different data flows,” says Mäki-Ullakko.

As a result, the team at Neste discovered the inherent demand for auditable records from its supply chain to support its clients with their emissions reduction strategies. This effort comes as companies require supply chain transparency in order to fulfil their goals.

Bringing IBM on board for ERP transformation

The importance of the relationship between Neste and IBM is, like any other partnership, alignment of views towards sustainability.

Towards the end of 2017, Nestle was developing its sustainable fuel supply chain and the need for transparency wasn’t truly realised until the company began working with IBM Consulting, which assisted in its delivery of end-to-end visibility.

“IBM fully understood and shared our vision for growing the renewable side of the business, and what it meant for our implementation roadmap,” says Juuso Pusa, Vice President Supply Chain Management of Renewable Products at Neste. “The fact that we were able to scale up and adapt the project on the fly attests to the closeness of relationship and the depth of resources and industry experience IBM was able to bring to the project.”

Over the years, the company—Neste and IBM—adopted a joint, experimental approach to developing the sustainable fuel firm’s visibility through sourcing and, as a result, Neste successfully adopted SAP S/4HANA on Microsoft Azure cloud across the majority of its supply chain operations. The team was also supported by Nordcloud, a cloud services training business for Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud and other software, to migrate the team to new systems.

8451,Nestlé & Cargill use cocoa shell in new lowcarbon fertiliser,,sustainabilitymag.com,https://sustainabilitymag.com/articles/nestle-cargill-use-cocoa-shell-in-new-lowcarbon-fertiliser,"Approximately 5% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are currently produced from the production and use of conventional fertiliser, and more than half of the carbon footprint of wheat grown in the UK is related to fertiliser use.

Nestlé UK & Ireland and Cargill have partnered to develop innovative solutions in regenerative agriculture. The initiative — a UK supply chain trial — aims to assess whether cocoa shells from a confectionery site in York could be used to create a low carbon fertiliser.

The trial to evaluate the fertiliser’s performance on crop production, soil health and GHG emissions reduction will last two years, and, if successful, could produce and offer up to 7,000 tonnes of low carbon fertiliser to farmers in Nestlé’s UK wheat supply chain. This amount of fertiliser equates to around 25% of Nestlé UK’s total fertiliser use for wheat.

“Farmers often find themselves to be among the first groups to be exposed to global issues, and these risks are then borne by the food system we all depend upon,” shares Matt Ryan, Regeneration Lead at Nestlé UK & Ireland.

“We have to find ways to build more resilience into the system and optimising our use of natural resources is a critical part of this.

“This project is a small, but very meaningful step towards a net zero future, where farmers, local enterprises, and nature all stand to benefit”

Reducing emissions across the supply chain

Cargill supplies the cocoa shells from its York facility where the shells are processed to become key ingredients in iconic products like KitKat and Aero.

Recycling valuable nutrients from waste streams within the food system provides a promising opportunity to create a lower emissions supply chain. Scaling up low carbon fertiliser production in the UK can provide farmers with a more sustainable product at a reliable price.

The trials, which were designed and are being overseen by York-based Fera Science Ltd, are currently taking place on arable farms in Suffolk and Northamptonshire. They are designed to investigate the performance of the fertiliser in terms of wheat yield and quality, as well as assess the impacts on soil biodiversity and GHG emissions in comparison to conventional products applied on the same farms.

“We have now finished harvesting and we’ve successfully grown a Winter wheat crop using this new fertiliser. We’ve compared two parts of the field, one which used the cocoa shell fertiliser, and one which used with the conventional fertiliser, and there is no significant difference in the yield so we can see that it works,” says Richard Ling, farm manager at Rookery Farm, Wortham in Norfolk, who supplies wheat to Nestlé Purina.

“We are really reassured with the results and are looking at running further trials. It’s a step change to be able to use a fertiliser made from a waste stream and see the same results as using a conventional product. It’s an exciting and promising time and we are pleased to be taking part in these trials to help reduce the carbon emissions from our farming.”

For all companies involved, the trial embodies their commitment to innovation, collaboration and sustainability throughout the supply chain. Alongside its pledge to net zero emissions by 2050, Nestlé has committed to sourcing 50% of its key ingredients from regenerative agricultural methods by 2030 and this project is an example of the innovative solutions supporting the company on that journey.

“Cargill and Nestlé have been working together for more than 60 years building resilient supply chains across communities where we both operate. We are excited to continue to build on this strong partnership through our innovative cocoa shell fertiliser trial,” says Sam Thompson, Global Engineering Lead at Cargill Cocoa & Chocolate.

“Together, we hope to contribute to a more sustainable future for the British farming industry.”

8553,Shell’s sustainable approach to lifecycle carbon emissions,,sustainabilitymag.com,https://sustainabilitymag.com/articles/shells-sustainable-approach-to-lifecycle-carbon-emissions,"Shell’s Aviation Services have announced a new approach to its lubricants, becoming one of the first in the sector to tackle lifecycle carbon emissions.

The energy giant is one of many companies globally with a target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, while supporting its clients on their journeys.

Developing strategies to achieve net zero in the aviation industry

The new approach aims to improve aircraft performance while helping customers meet net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) or carbon emission goals through avoiding, reducing and compensating for lifecycle carbon emissions.

This sustainable approach is being adopted across AeroShell, including turbine engine oils (TEOs), piston engine oils (PEOs), greases and fluids, for both the commercial airline and general aviation markets.

Shell is working towards its net zero goal by:

Optimising production, including taking out over 55 KTonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) of Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from the global lubricants operations, reducing production step carbon intensity by more than 45% since 2016.

Enhancing product design, including using more recycled content in product plastic packaging, in support of Shell’s ambition of reaching 30% PCR use by 2030.

Embedding circularity into product packaging.

Improving the energy efficiency of facilities — over 50% of the electricity imported to Shell Global Lube Oil Blending Plants (LOBPs) now comes directly from renewable sources through the installation of solar photovoltaics (PV) panels and green power contracts, or indirectly using renewable energy credits (RECs). The installation of solar PV panels at 11 lubricant blending plants, is expected to generate over 11,000 MWh of electricity annually, and can result in the avoidance of GHG emissions of over 6,000 tonnes CO2e per year.

Using renewable energy to reduce emissions across the supply chain and optimising delivery networks to reduce road transport by 1.3 million miles since 2021.

Compensating for carbon emissions that aren’t being avoided or reduced by purchasing carbon credits.

Increasing the use of re-refined base oils.

“While SAF and fuel efficiency are rightly highlighted as key levers to decarbonise aviation, for the aviation sector to reach net zero it must address emissions from all aspects of aircraft operations in order to decarbonise — so this means lubricants too, even if they do represent a small proportion of aviation emissions when compared to jet fuel,” says Vincent Begon, General Manager Aviation Lubricants, Shell Aviation.

“It is a real point of pride that AeroShell will now support our customers in maintaining aircraft performance while taking action on decarbonisation.”

Shell Aviation believes that Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is essential in achieving the net-zero goal, and is working to be a SAF producer from 2025.

The company is working globally to support developing technologies and work towards the decarbonisation of aviation, investing in production pathways such as Alcohol to Jet (AtJ) technology.

To accelerate the transition, the business has identified three key investment strategies: increase investments in renewable energy, maintain investments in integrated gas and chemicals and limit investments in upstream oil and gas.

“The fundamentals of lubricants mean that they are challenging to decarbonise, so a lot of effort has gone into developing this new proposition, including working with Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), distributors and other key players across the lubricants industry. This is an important development for our aviation lubricants business, and one that we are confident will provide genuine value for our customers as we support them in decarbonising.”",sustainability_news,2023-07-14 08:43:13+00:00,2025-04-01 12:15:57.875584,"['Shell', 'Aviation Services', '##S', 'Shell', 'Shell', 'Shell Global Lube Oil Blending Plants', 'L', '##OBPs', 'Inc', 'SA']",Shell,2023.0,shell,1.0

Twelve combines renewable energy and water to convert CO2 into vital chemicals and materials derived from fossil fuels. This innovative formula reduces lifecycle emissions by 90% compared to traditional fossil-based fuels and is compatible with current aircrafts.

Etihad’s sustainable mission

The new partnership aligns with Etihad's sustainability goals of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 and converting waste into fuel, with a target of diverting 75% of waste from landfills by 2025. The collaboration is driven by the growing demand for SAF among various airlines.

In 2019, the airline introduced the Etihad Greenliner Program, which allocated a Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner to focus on sustainability initiatives. The programme aims to identify and tackle key sustainability challenges through partnerships with Boeing and engine manufacturer GE.",sustainability_news,2023-05-15 09:13:18+00:00,2025-04-01 12:17:57.594082,"['E', '##tihad Airways', 'Twelve', 'Twelve', 'Etihad', 'Etihad', 'SAF', 'Boeing', 'GE']",Etihad Airways,2023.0,etihad,0.7912781238555908

Kara Hurst , Vice President and Head of Worldwide Sustainability at Amazon comments: “Even as we scaled our business at an unprecedented pace to help meet the needs of our customers through the pandemic, we saw a 1.9% reduction in our carbon intensity in 2021.

“As we invest in new products and services, it will continue to be important for us to measure how fast we reduce our carbon intensity so we can both meet our customer needs and reach our net-zero carbon goal by 2040.”

Decarbonising the economy - Amazon’s Climate Pledge

Through The Climate Pledge , Amazon came together with hundreds of partners together to address the climate crisis and help solve the challenges of decarbonising the economy. The Climate Pledge is a commitment to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040—10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement. In 2021, 253 companies joined Amazon as signatories of The Climate Pledge—an increase of more than 700% in signatories over the previous year. Today, the Pledge has more than 300 signatories from over 51 industries and 29 countries.

In 2021, Amazon delivered more than 100 million packages to its customers across Europe with a fleet of over 3,000 electric delivery vans and other zero-emission vehicles. Over half a million packages were also delivered to its customers’ doorsteps in North America with electric vehicles. “And in July,” adds Hurst, “we announced that our custom delivery vehicles from Rivian started hitting the road in more than a dozen cities across the U.S.—what is the start of thousands in more than 100 cities by the end of 2022.”

Through its Climate Pledge Friendly programme, Amazon helps customers in the U.S. and Europe discover and shop for more-sustainable products. Since it launched Climate Pledge Friendly in 2020, the number of products included in the programme has grown from 75,000 to more than 250,000 by the end of 2021. “In 2021, more than 370 million Climate Pledge Friendly units were shipped to Amazon customers, and we welcomed 20 new third-party sustainability certifications to the programme,” says Hurst.

9234,How does Amazon provide consumers with sustainable choices?,,sustainabilitymag.com,https://sustainabilitymag.com/sustainability/how-does-amazon-provide-consumers-with-sustainable-choices,"As the largest e-commerce retailer in the world, promoting sustainability is a critical task for Amazon as it is responsible for the sale of over 350 million products each year. With an incredibly large platform that spans the majority of the globe, it’s no wonder that Amazon is now using it to help its customers make more sustainable choices when buying goods.



Amazon has implemented some different brands or initiatives to ensure that consumers are presented with sustainably-sourced products while supporting its business-to-business (B2B) clients, such as startups and sustainability-focused brands.

Amazon brand initiatives to promote sustainable sourcing

Without the sale of sustainable products, consumers won’t be able to make the switch. Amazon has devised some great initiatives to put sustainable products on its website and encourage a shift in the purchasing habits of its customer base.







Amazon Launchpad



In mid-2019, Amazon began to serve more business startups through the implementation of its Amazon Launchpad—a service that assists entrepreneurs to overcome the challenges of entering competitive markets.



Leading up to Earth Day, Amazon is sharing the stories of some small brands hosted on its website, including those of kitchenware, beauty and health, clothing and accessories, and groceries.







Climate Pledge Friendly



Awareness is an important factor in Amazon’s pledge to sustainability. The Climate Pledge Friendly programme helps customers discover more sustainable options for their usual purchases. This is achieved through certification. 39 different certifications are used on the Amazon website to represent products that support the natural environment.



Across various product lines, the count of recognised products exceeds 300,000, which come from around 20,000 different brands.





Amazon Aware





Amazon is known to produce its own products, such as its Amazon Basics line, but its Amazon Aware brand is slightly different. It was created to provide all Amazon customers with a base option for sustainable goods. Shopping the Amazon Aware ranges of beauty, household, and clothing products give consumers peace of mind that they all fit within its Climate Pledge Friendly programme.





Amazon Smile



Many browsers will have seen the Amazon Smile logo across its website and on other branding materials. The retail giant is taking charity to another level, by offering consumers the chance to purchase the same goods while supporting charitable causes. Smile.amazon.com is the firm’s answer to this and it has managed to provide the same products and services, and donate a percentage of its revenue to charities, all at no extra cost to the customer.

9616,HSBC UK launches £500m green SME fund,,sustainabilitymag.com,https://sustainabilitymag.com/diversity-and-inclusion-dandi/hsbc-uk-launches-ps500m-green-sme-fund,"HSBC UK has announced the launch of a £500m Green SME Fund as part of its ongoing commitment to support businesses of all sizes to transition and thrive in a low carbon economy.

It follows HSBC’s global commitment to provide between USD750 billion and USD1 trillion of financing and investment to support its customers over the next 10 years.

While the sustainable finance market has predominately focused on larger corporations, small and medium-sized enterprises are increasingly being described as the ‘new front’ in the battle against climate change.

The new £500m fund is available for businesses with a turnover of less than £25m and will offer 1% cashback on loans, starting from £1,0002 to help SMEs invest in green activities. This is the first green offering for small businesses with a cashback proposal in the UK.

To qualify for the cashback, evidence must be provided that the use of the loan proceeds meet HSBC’s Eligible Criteria for Green Activities, which have been independently reviewed by Sustainalytics.

Furthermore, HSBC UK is launching a Sustainability Assessment Tool that provides actionable insights and resources to help businesses transition to net zero.

Speaking from COP26 today, Ian Stuart, CEO HSBC UK enthused: “I am delighted to announce to the launch of HSBC UK’s £500m Green SME Fund. Companies of all sizes and sectors have a role to play in the journey to net zero, however the sustainable finance market has been predominately focused on larger corporations. It’s critical that access to funds isn’t a barrier for small and medium sized businesses working to achieve lower carbon emissions.""

“We want to help businesses seize the opportunities and growth potential that environmental sustainability offers and the fund, along with our new and expanding suite of tools and resources, will make it easier for small businesses to take practical steps to cut their emissions and help their customers to cut theirs too,” he added.

Expanding tools, resources and expertise

Businesses of all sizes are urged to act now, as they face increasing governmental pressure to reduce emissions, as well as increased pressure from consumers.

New research from HSBC UK3 has found that despite half of businesses feeling pressure from customers, government and the media, just 23% are measuring environmental metrics. While a quarter of small businesses want to play their part, believing that a focus on environmental sustainability will grow their business in the next 12 months, they told us that cost is a key barrier.

HSBC UK wants to help remove the barriers small businesses face in the drive to transition to a lower carbon economy.

The Green SME fund and the Sustainability Assessment Tool are the latest additions to HSBC UK’s sector expertise and green product range for British businesses. These include:

Dedicated Sustainable Finance team

500 sustainability ambassadors around the UK

Green SME Fund

Green Term Loans

Sustainability Linked Loans

Green Revolving Credit Facilities

Green Asset Finance

Green Deposits

Green and Sustainable Trade Finance

Green and Sustainability Linked Bonds

Sustainability Hub



Case in point

Showing its commitment to supporting customers to transition to net zero, HSBC has already provided funding to David Luke Schoolwear.

The Manchester-based school uniform provider has installed over 1,000 solar panels with support from HSBC UK to reduce carbon emissions and cut costs. Utilising a six-figure funding package to install 1,700 sq mtrs of ERS solar panels at its headquarters in central Manchester.

As a result of the installation, the business will have the capacity to generate a peak solar array of 295kw-h onsite, enabling a 25-tonne reduction in carbon emissions every year. Over a 25 year solar-lifespan, David Luke Schoolwear is expecting to save up to 3,600 tonnes in carbon emissions.

The funding provided by HSBC UK comes as part of a Green Loan, dedicated funding to support sustainability projects and help SMEs and mid-market companies achieve their green ambitions.",sustainability_news,2021-11-05 11:34:40+00:00,2025-04-01 12:36:47.752464,"['HSBC UK', 'Green SME Fund', 'HSBC', 'SM', 'H', '##SBC', 'Sustainalytics', 'H', '##SBC UK', 'HSBC UK', 'HSBC UK', 'Green SME Fund']",HSBC UK,2021.0,hsbc,0.9049394130706787
9945,Adidas Responds to Consumer Sustainability Demand Changes,,sustainabilitymag.com,https://sustainabilitymag.com/esg/adidas-responds-consumer-sustainability-demand-changes,"The global footwear industry, valued at over US$350bn annually, is seeing changes in the way companies make and sell their products. There is currently an emphasis on sustainably sourced materials - including the materials themselves and the labour to produce them - as consumers take to more responsibly sourced products. Adidas carried out a company survey, which provides insights into consumer mindsets.

Consumer Morals Shape The Market

Kasper Rorsted, Chief Executive Officer at Adidas, released information from the survey at the company’s annual general meeting (AGM). While customers tend to look at the design of footwear, comfort or functionality, and the price tag, it’s clear from this survey there is one more aspect that is considered: Sustainability.

According to Rorsted, “70% of all consumers say that they consider sustainability a significant buying argument.“ This resonates with the company, which prides itself on responsibly sourcing its products. Rorsted adds, “if we succeed in sustainability – or when – we also succeed as a business.”

Adidas’ Sustainable History

Adidas has worked incredibly hard over the years to create a sustainable company image. The company’s sustainability journey spans over more than thirty years, as it looks to positively contribute to issues, such as international human rights and labour rights, environmentally friendly supply chains, and waste management.

The company’s initial environmental contributions were put in place as early as 1989 when it set out to eliminate the use of harmful chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and processes in the production of its footwear. The company also claims that SF6 gases have never been used in its products, which is one of the most severe substances that impact the environment.

Meeting Consumer Values

Every day, there are more initiatives that appear beneficial to consumers when it comes to purchasing products. Historically there has been an emphasis on production energy usage and limiting the use of harmful gases. But the consumer mindset has shifted towards sustainable sourcing of materials, including the knowledge of where the materials come from, the ability to say that products are not causing any harm or discomfort to those in the supply chain - in financial terms and working conditions and that materials are recyclable or companies have schemes to reuse their products.

Adidas has made even more changes in line with its sustainability efforts. The company is now working on using plastics in its footwear, which have been recycled from ocean waste. It has also teamed up with Allbirds, a company that produces low-carbon footwear products, to make use of its expertise in creating footwear that contains merino wool, recycled bottle plastics, cardboard, and castor bean oil. The company also plans to release its classic footwear type, the Stan Smith shoe, using a leather derived from mycelium - the fibrous root structure of mushrooms.",sustainability_news,2021-06-23 14:00:00+00:00,2025-04-01 12:43:21.965754,"['Adidas', 'Adidas', 'Adidas', 'Sustainable History', 'Adidas', '##idas']",Adidas,2021.0,adidas,1.0
10036,What is a circular economy?,,sustainabilitymag.com,https://sustainabilitymag.com/diversity-and-inclusion-dandi/what-circular-economy,"Over the next few centuries, historians will be researching the impact of net-zero targets made during the Coronavirus pandemic. Teachers will be helping students to revise what happened on the day the last drop of oil was burned. Archaeologists will be wondering “How did we get into this mess?” as they dig through ancient 21st century landfill sites, where some of the single-use plastic used this week will be slowly rotting.

A circular economy is a model of production with a sustainable future in mind, where manufacturers are aware of the infinite and finite resources which they use. Let’s break down what a circular economy is - and what it is not.

The linear model of production

A wasteful model of production is ‘take, make, dispose’, with a clear beginning, middle and an ending.

Companies buy the resources needed to make their product at the lowest possible price. The company then sells as many of the product as they can at an affordable price tol make a profit. This profit goes back into buying more resources to make more products and expanding the company. For example:

Take: A manufacturer pays farmers for an ingredient and takes it to their factory.

Make: The ingredient is used to make the desired item and sold to the consumer.

Dispose: When the product is no longer needed by the consumer, it is thrown away. The product may end up in landfill or the sea.

Finite resources and space

Waste is sent to landfills and into the sea, locations which are not sources of infinite space. Some of the ingredients used to manufacture products are also finite..

If production remains at its current rate, the planet is expected to run out of many essential resources throughout the next century:

The fossil fuels oil, gas and uranium, are expected to run out in the 2040s, with the last lump of coal being mined in the 2050s.

Fresh supplies of zinc, silver, copper and gold will also be finished, within the next decade.

The ocean is suspected to contain more plastic than fish by 2050. Maybe even earlier if the plastic inside of the fish is included. The world’s largest landfill site is the Ghazipur garbage dump in India, which at one point was taller than the Taj Mahal (73m).

A circular economy seeks to eliminate waste disposed of in the ocean and minimise the use of landfills.

The circular economy model of production

A circular economy respects the space restrictions of current methods of production and waste, as well as the limit of materials and the environment.

Make: Manufacturers create something, with its future in mind. For example,

Use: The consumer buys the item and uses it. When the item has served its purpose, the consumer can return the item to the manufacturer or take it to a dedicated location where it can be repurposed.

Recycle: The item is taken away to be recycled, reused or repaired and begins its journey again, in the circular economy.

Who is implementing a circular economy?

As reported by Sustainability, retailer H&M has started a new initiative, Looop, where customers can donate their old or unwanted clothes at their local branch. These items are sent off to be remade into new products and sold to a new consumer.

Water, our planet's most precious resource, is naturally recycled - we collect water, use it and then flush it away. It is believed that every water molecule has been drunk at least four times, including by dinosaurs. So it’s only natural for recycling to permeate every other aspect of our lives in the circular economy.",sustainability_news,2021-05-05 10:22:19+00:00,2025-04-01 12:45:08.646301,[],H&M,2021.0,h&m,1.0
11146,Shell shifts strategy away from reducing oil production,,sustainability-news.net,https://sustainability-news.net/net-zero/shell-shifts-strategy-away-from-reducing-oil-production/,"Shell, one of the world’s largest oil companies, has made a significant strategic shift by opting to maximise profits and prioritise shareholder returns over a previously planned gradual reduction of oil production.

In an announcement made today (June 14), Shell unveiled its updated strategy, detailing its intention to “stabilise liquids production until 2030.” According to the statement, this move aims to extend the company’s competitive position and ensure “cash flow longevity.”

The new approach contrasts the commitments set by former CEO Ben van Beurden in 2021, who had aimed to reduce the production of “traditional fuels” by 55% before 2030. Van Beurden’s plan involved an annual decrease of 1-2% throughout the 2020s.

Wael Sawan, who took over as CEO in September, commented on this change by stating, “We are investing to provide the secure energy customers need today and for a long time to come, while transforming Shell to win in a low-carbon future.

“We need to continue to create profitable business models that can be scaled at pace to truly impact the decarbonisation of the global energy system. We will invest in the models that work – those with the highest returns that play to our strengths.”

Despite the new approach, Sawan reiterated the company’s commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. However, Shell acknowledged that reaching this goal might prove challenging, stating that “if society is not net zero in 2050, as of today, there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.”

As part of its revised strategy, Shell plans to allocate between $10 billion (£7.8bn) and $15 billion (£11.8bn) from 2023 to 2025 to “low-carbon” initiatives, which include biofuels, hydrogen, electric vehicle charging, and carbon capture and storage projects.

Moreover, the oil giant unveiled its intention to increase dividends by 15% and return $5 billion (£4bn) to shareholders through a share buyback program, pending Board approval.

According to Shell, this strategic shift aims to strike a balance between meeting the immediate energy demands of customers while pursuing profitable business models that contribute to the long-term decarbonisation of the global energy system.",sustainability_news,2023-06-14 15:56:59+00:00,2025-04-01 14:52:58.464928,"['Shell', 'Shell', 'Shell', 'S', '##UBSCRIBE', 'Shell', 'Shell', 'Shell', 'Shell']",Shell,2023.0,shell,1.0

The Sacramento-area delivery site, which aims to provide same-day delivery to customers, was constructed using sustainable building materials, including lower carbon concrete, and a fully electrified heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system. Additionally, it is equipped with more efficient technology that helps it reduce operational carbon emissions.

The building is designed to have a rooftop solar array that can produce as much as 80% of the facility’s annual energy needs. The rest will come from Amazon’s other renewable energy projects.

“This new facility represents a leap forward in sustainable construction for our global operations, which we intend to use as a model for future buildings across Amazon, as we continue working towards meeting our Climate Pledge commitment to be net-zero carbon across our operations by 2040,” said Kara Hurst, vice president of worldwide sustainability at Amazon.

The distribution hub is the first in the world to pursue the ILFI Zero Carbon Certification, the first worldwide third-party certified standard of its kind. Certification requires buildings to meet certain energy and carbon reduction targets, be powered by 100% renewable energy, and offset 100% of emissions associated with their construction. Amazon expects the site to receive certification in 2023, one year after the site is fully operational.

The news follows a series of sustainability focused moves from Amazon over the last few years. In October, the retail giant announced it was looking to invest €1 billion (£861M) into its European EV logistics fleet, and only the month before, in September, it secured an agreement with Plug Power to supply 10,950 tons per year of green hydrogen for its transportation and building operations.

The company has emerged as the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy and is on track to power all of its activities with renewable energy by 2025.

The latest announcement reinforces Amazons commitments as part of its Climate Pledge. The Climate Pledge was launched by Amazon and Global Optimism in 2019 and commits signatories to reaching the goals of the Paris Agreement 10 years earlier by attaining net-zero carbon across all operations by 2040. As of today, 462 companies have signed up to the pledge, including Microsoft, Unilever, Verizon, and Mercedes-Benz, among others.

Despite the progress Amazon has made, the companies latest sustainability report revealed an 18% increase in its carbon footprint. However, the company claims that this is not the correct metric to look at.",sustainability_news,2022-11-02 11:04:28+00:00,2025-04-01 14:57:18.457864,"['Amazon', 'International Living Future Institute', 'ILFI', 'Amazon', 'P', '##lug Power', 'Microsoft', 'Mercedes', 'Benz']",Amazon,2022.0,amazon,1.0000001192092896
11335,Fast fashion brand Zara to launch resale and repair service in the UK,,sustainability-news.net,https://sustainability-news.net/sustainability/fast-fashion-brand-zara-to-launch-resale-and-repair-service-in-the-uk/,"Spanish multi-national retailer Zara has stepped into the resale market as it reveals plans to launch its own pre-owned platform in the UK.

The new service, which launches on 3 November, will be Zara’s first step into resale or repair and will enable shoppers to book repairs and donate unwanted items originally bought from the retailer. Customers will also be able to post unwanted Zara purchases online for resale to other customers.

The merchant says that the service is not expected to be profitable at first, but it will help customers “extend the lifetime of their clothes” by using a more circular approach.

While the initiative is a step in the right direction, critics have argued that Zara is still a ‘fast fashion’ brand, and produce a lot of poor quality and disposable clothing designs that take advantage of often fleeting trends.

According to the UN Environment Programme, the fashion industry is the second-biggest consumer of water and is responsible for 8-10% of global carbon emissions – more than all international flights and maritime shipping combined.

The negative environmental impact of the fashion industry has led to brands introducing campaigns to convince customers of their sustainability. Some types of clothing are often labelled “sustainable” or “eco-friendly” without the company having proof that the claim is true.

Earlier this year, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) started investigations into Asos, BooHoo, and Asda to look into their “green” claims. These investigations came after concerns about how these companies’ products were being marketed to customers as eco-friendly.

“People who want to ‘buy green’ should be able to do so confident that they aren’t being misled. Eco-friendly and sustainable products can play a role in tackling climate change, but only if they are genuine.” said Sarah Cardell, interim Chief Executive of the CMA.

The second-hand clothing market is expected to grow to over £65 billion in the year 2022, according to a Future Market Insights report. In the next decade, the market is expected to grow by 14.8% each year as people embrace the environmental benefits of using second-hand clothes.

Zara joins many retailers dabbling with the rental, resale, and repair market, with brands from Mulberry, Harvey Nichols, Decathlon to Dr Martens and H&M taking part.

In a similar move, October saw French sports retail giant brand Decathlon change their name to “Nohltaced” to promote their new reverse selling scheme. This scheme is meant to encourage more circulatory in the industry and “reduce the impact on our environment and avoid waste.”",sustainability_news,2022-10-26 10:18:50+00:00,2025-04-01 14:57:28.055736,"['Zara', 'Zara', 'Zara', 'Zara', 'UN Environment Programme', 'Competition and Markets Authority', 'CMA', 'Asos', 'Bo', '##oHoo', 'Asda', 'CMA', 'Z', 'Harvey Nichols', 'Mart']",Zara,2022.0,zara,1.0000001192092896
11363,Amazon to invest over €1 billion into European EV logistics fleet,,sustainability-news.net,https://sustainability-news.net/sustainability/amazon-to-invest-over-e1-billion-into-european-ev-logistics-fleet/,"Tech giant Amazon is looking to invest more than €1 billion into electric vans, trucks, and low emission package hubs over the next five years towards their goal of net zero emissions by 2040.

According to a recent Reuters report, the investment will help Amazon build its European fleet of vans, or “last-mile” vehicles, by increasing the current number of 3,000 zero-emission vehicles to over 10,000 by 2025.

Additionally, Amazon plans to purchase more than 1,500 electric heavy goods vehicles, also known as “middle-mile” delivery vehicles, to be used between package hubs.

The news follows Amazons July announcement that they would be buying over 100,000 electric vans from Rivian Automotive. They plan to have these vans on US roads by 2030.

Speaking of the US purchase, RJ Scaringe, CEO of Rivian said, “Today represents an important step, not just for Amazon and Rivian as partners, but also for transportation and the environment,”

The company said that alongside its European EV expansion, it will invest in thousands of chargers at facilities across the continent.

The investment reinforces the goal set forth in Amazons Climate Pledge, which aims to reach net zero by 2040. The pledge includes other notable companies, including Microsoft, Unilever, Verizon, and Mercedes-Benz.

Other companies in the logistics sector, such as FedEx and UPS, are also hoping to expand their electric delivery fleets. FedEx intends to convert its entire parcel pickup and delivery fleet to electric, zero-emissions vehicles by 2040. Whereas, UPS has a goal of reaching carbon neutrality by 2050 and achieving 40% alternative fuel in ground operations by 2025.",sustainability_news,2022-10-10 11:38:13+00:00,2025-04-01 14:57:56.712313,"['Amazon', 'Reuters', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'R', '##ivian Automotive', 'R', '##ivian', 'Amazon', 'R', '##ivian', 'Microsoft', 'Unilever', 'V', '##erizon', 'Mercedes - Benz', 'FedEx', 'UPS', 'FedEx', 'UPS']",Amazon,2022.0,amazon,1.0000001192092896
11384,Amazon announces 71 new clean energy projects,,sustainability-news.net,https://sustainability-news.net/net-zero/amazon-announces-71-new-clean-energy-projects/,"Amazon is expanding its global renewable energy investments with 71 new renewable energy projects around the world, generating up to 50,000 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of clean energy.

The projects will power Amazon’s offices, fulfilment centres, data centres, and stores. Once completed, the tech giant’s complete portfolio will boast a total of 379 renewable energy projects across 21 countries and generate the equivalent amount of electricity required to power 4.6 million U.S. homes each year.

Included in this latest batch is Amazon’s first renewable energy project for South America. A 122 MW solar farm in Brazil which, according to Amazon, will also provide ‘economic benefits to the local economy and the region’s biodiversity’ in addition to providing renewable power to Amazon’s operations in the region.

The tech giant is currently the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy globally, and as of the end of 2021, reached 85% renewable energy use around its business. With the inclusion of this latest batch of generation projects, Amazon hopes to increase this moving forward.

“We are bringing new wind and solar projects online to power our offices, fulfilment centres, data centres, and stores, which collectively serve millions of customers globally, and we are on a path to reach 100% renewable energy across our entire business by 2025. Around the world, countries are looking to accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy, and continued investments like ours can help accelerate their journey as we all work together to mitigate the impacts of climate change,” said Adam Selipsky, CEO of Amazon Web Services.

The expansion is being completed through the Clean Energy Buyers Institutes (CEBI) ‘Beyond the Megawatt’ initiative. The initiative, launched this year, aims to ensure that future renewable energy procurement is done so through ‘resilient, equitable, and environmentally sustainable’ energy systems..

“As a key leader in the CEBA community, Amazon continues to demonstrate that when it commits to a vision, it drives a pace and scale that’s a new bar to follow,” said Miranda Ballentine, CEO of Clean Energy Buyers Association (CEBA) and Clean Energy Buyers Institute (CEBI).

In 2019, Amazon co-founded The Climate Pledge, committing to achieve net zero carbon by 2040 – 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement. The Pledge now has more than 375 signatories, including IBM, Microsoft, PepsiCo, Unilever, and Visa.

In order to support the goal, the Amazon is also investing $2 billion into the development of decarbonizing services and solutions through its Climate Pledge Fund. A corporate venture capital fund which invests in companies that can accelerate Amazon’s path to meeting The Climate Pledge goals.

Through the fund, Amazon recently announced its partnership with Rivian, an electric vehicle manufacturer that is working with the company to deploy 100,000 electric delivery vehicles onto U.S. roads. Amazon is also working with Plug Power, developer of hydrogen fuel cells, to supply 10,950 tons per year of green hydrogen for its transportation and building operations.

However, despite taking steps to reduce its carbon footprint, the companies latest annual report revealed an 18% increase in its emissions. But, the company claims this isn’t the correct metric to look at, instead suggesting carbon intensity should be front and centre.

“As companies invest in new products and services, and their businesses grow substantially, the focus should not be solely on a company’s carbon footprint in terms of absolute carbon emissions, but also on whether it’s lowering its carbon intensity,” the report notes. “Over time, continued decreases in carbon intensity can lead to lower absolute emissions.”",sustainability_news,2022-09-23 14:46:23+00:00,2025-04-01 14:58:18.005738,"['Amazon Web Services', 'Clean Energy Buyers Institutes', 'CEBI', 'Miranda', 'Ball', 'Association', 'CE', 'Energy', 'Institute', 'CE', 'IBM', 'Microsoft']",Amazon,2022.0,amazon,1.0000001192092896
11391,Amazon adopts zero-emission fuel to help decarbonize its operations,,sustainability-news.net,https://sustainability-news.net/net-zero/amazon-adopts-zero-emission-fuel/,"Amazon has secured an agreement with Plug Power to supply 10,950 tons per year of green hydrogen for its transportation and building operations starting in 2025.

The agreement will see Plug Power provide enough hydrogen annually to power 30,000 forklifts or 800 heavy-duty trucks, contributing to Amazon’s Climate Pledge goals, alongside other initiatives, including the rollout of its fully electric delivery fleet.

As Amazon aims to hit its net-zero carbon target by 2040, 10 years earlier than the date set forth in the Paris Agreement, it plans to use the more climate friendly green hydrogen to replace grey hydrogen, diesel, and other fossil fuels to decarbonise its operations. Green and grey hydrogen are both produced by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen; however, the former does so using energy from renewable sources, whereas the latter relies on energy generated by fossil fuels.

Over 95% of Amazon’s current supply is made from fossil fuels, and in their latest annual sustainability report it revealed an 18% increase in its carbon footprint. To tackle this issue, agreements like this one are intended to promote the growth of green hydrogen, which is produced through a zero-carbon pathway using water and renewable electricity.

“Amazon is proud to be an early adopter of green hydrogen given its potential to decarbonise hard-to-abate sectors like long-haul trucking, steel manufacturing, aviation, and ocean shipping,” said Kara Hurst, vice president of Worldwide Sustainability at Amazon. “We are relentless in our pursuit to meet our Climate Pledge commitment to be net-zero carbon across our operations by 2040 and believe that scaling the supply and demand for green hydrogen, such as through this agreement with Plug Power, will play a key role in helping us achieve our goals.”

To power Amazon’s operations using renewable electricity, more hydrogen-powered equipment will be made commercially available. Therefore, in addition to the supply contract with Plug Power, Amazon has invested in two companies developing electrolyzer technology to increase green hydrogen production.

The investment is part of the Climate Pledge Fund, Amazon’s $2bn venture investment program that supports the development of sustainable technologies and services, and has currently been signed by over 320 organizations who have committed to achieving net-zero carbon by 2040.

Amazon vice president of Global Engineering and Security Services Dean Fullerton commented: “We already have more than 70 fulfilment centres outfitted with hydrogen storage and dispensing systems, which will allow us to start using green hydrogen to replace fossil fuels. Today, we use that system to power over 15,000 fuel-cell propelled forklifts, with plans to grow that number to 20,000 across 100 fulfilment centres by 2025. That’s just the start. Across Amazon’s operations, we’re exploring and testing the use of other hydrogen applications, such as fuel-cell electric trucks and fuel-cell power generation stations providing electricity to Amazon buildings.”

Plug Power CEO Andy Marsh added: “Plug is fully committed to a green hydrogen future, and we are building a complete hydrogen ecosystem—from molecule to applications combined with a resilient network of green hydrogen plants around the world—to make hydrogen adoption easy for companies looking to reach net-zero carbon emissions. Securing this major green hydrogen supply deal with a customer like Amazon affirms our multi-year investment and strategic expansion into green hydrogen.”

“We are honoured to help Amazon meet its ambitious sustainability goals and look forward to possibly expanding our relationship with other hydrogen applications, such as fuel-cell electric trucks and fuel-cell power generation stations that could provide electricity to Amazon buildings and the deployment of electrolyzers in fulfilment centres.”",sustainability_news,2022-09-02 09:45:19+00:00,2025-04-01 14:58:26.419800,"['Amazon', 'P', '##lug Power', 'Plug Power', 'Worldwide Sustainability at', 'Pledge', 'P', '##lug Power', 'Amazon', 'Dean', 'Fuller']",Amazon,2022.0,amazon,1.0000001192092896
11404,"Amazon’s emissions increased by 18% last year, but is this the right metric to use?",,sustainability-news.net,https://sustainability-news.net/net-zero/amazons-sustainability-report-2021/,"The latest annual sustainability report, published earlier this week, is a 100-page smorgasbord of ideas, innovation, and initiatives. While the report freely admits it is early days and Amazon doesn’t have all the answers yet, the tone is one of measured optimism.

Go to page 97 however, and there is one stat which does not chime with this tone. Amazon’s total emissions for 2021 equated to 71.54 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. 2020’s was 60.64m. Amazon’s footprint actually went up to the tune of 18%, and almost 40% from 2019.

The company, however, is keen to point out that this figure isn’t really that important. Amazon prefers to analyse its progress in terms of ‘carbon intensity’, measuring how much CO2 emissions are produced per dollar of gross merchandise sales. On this metric, Amazon’s carbon intensity has gone down for the third year running, decreasing 1.9% this time round.

“As companies invest in new products and services, and their businesses grow substantially, the focus should not be solely on a company’s carbon footprint in terms of absolute carbon emissions, but also on whether it’s lowering its carbon intensity,” the report notes. “Over time, continued decreases in carbon intensity can lead to lower absolute emissions.”

There is an obvious mitigating factor for Amazon’s increased footprint in the form of Covid-19. Increased consumer demand led the company to expand its logistics and delivery networks, as well as new warehouses. Amazon says it has incurred more than $15bn in Covid-related costs to keep employees safe while responding to demand.

Amazon’s sheer size – and the responsibility this means – has been officially incorporated into its leadership principles. These principles adorn countless business studies textbooks, so their influence cannot be overstated. Broadly, the latest addendum reads “we are big, we impact the world, and we are far from perfect. We must be humble and thoughtful about even the secondary effects of our actions. Our local communities, planet, and future generations need us to be better every day.”

This can be seen in various Amazon environmental and social commitments in areas which many companies may not be able to explore. $2 billion (£1.64bn) has been invested through the Amazon Housing Equity Fund to support affordable housing, while as part of the company’s upskilling plans, 9,000 transportation associates have been trained to identify and respond to potential victims of human trafficking.

The Climate Pledge, with its commitment to net-zero by 2040, is a clear area of success. The initiative now has more than 300 organisations who have signed up, with $2bn investment to support the development of sustainable technologies. One such example is in new Amazon electric delivery vehicles built alongside Rivian, one of the first companies to benefit from the pledge fund.

Other milestones in the report include progress on commitments to power Amazon’s operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025. At the end of 2021 this number was at 85% for electricity across Amazon’s businesses, with 274 renewable projects in the works. More than 100 million packages were delivered using zero-emission vehicles last year, while 1.5 million tons of packaging has been eliminated since 2015.

It is therefore a self-imposed ‘could do better’ from Amazon, but built on solid foundations. “We are proud of the progress we’ve made, but we recognise we have more to do,” wrote Kara Hurst, Amazon VP worldwide sustainability. “Our everyday actions to deliver progress are in service of achieving long-term, systemic change that improves the well-being of people, communities, and the planet.”

“The path to achieving some of our goals will be long and complex, but we are not deterred.”

11406,Amazon’s new electric delivery fleet rolls out across the U.S,,sustainability-news.net,https://sustainability-news.net/supply-chain/amazons-new-electric-delivery-fleet-rolls-out-across-the-u-s/,"Amazon’s electric delivery vehicles have begun rolling out across a number of U.S. cities, with 100 cities planned by the end of this year, and 100,000 vehicles across the U.S. by 2030. An important step towards achieving its sustainable commitments.

Built from the ground up, the vehicles are the product of a 3-year collaboration between Amazon and electric automotive company Rivian. One of the first companies Amazon invested in as part of The Climate Pledge in 2019, Rivian has been designing electric vehicles since 2009 and hopes to play a significant part in accomplishing Amazon’s emission reduction goals.

Co-founded by Amazon and Global Optimism, The Climate Pledge commits to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement 10 years early by attaining net-zero carbon across all operations by 2040. So far, 319 signatories have signed up to the pledge, including Microsoft, Unilever, Verizon, and Mercedes-Benz, among others.

“Today marks a significant milestone in our Climate Pledge commitment.” says Amazon CEO, Andy Jassy, “Rivian was one of the first companies Amazon invested in through the Climate Pledge Fund, and we’re just getting started on our journey to have 100,000 of Rivian’s vehicles on the road by 2030”

The new design, first revealed in 2020 has been tested in the field since 2021 and has delivered over 430,000 packages, accumulating over 90,000 miles. Amazon says this testing has allowed Rivian to continuously improve the vehicle’s performance, safety, and durability in various climates and geographies as well as its state-of-the-art features to ensure driver satisfaction, and overall functionality.

Features include a safety-first design focused on protecting drivers and pedestrians, first-of-its-kind embedded technology enabling seamless access to delivery workflows, and driver experience enhancements aimed at making the delivery experience easier. The trucks will also include long-lasting batteries that should survive the lifetime of the vehicle.

“Today represents an important step, not just for Amazon and Rivian as partners, but also for transportation and the environment,” said RJ Scaringe, CEO of Rivian. “In 2019, Rivian, and Amazon committed to fast-tracking a new type of delivery vehicle that would result in a significant reduction of carbon emissions. Thanks to our teams’ dedication, hard work and collaboration, and a shared commitment to make the world a better place for our kids’ kids, that vision is now being realized.”

In addition to the new delivery fleet, Amazon is investing heavily into a charging infrastructure across the country to support their use. Also partnering with the non-profit CERES, and several other fleet operators to launch the Corporate Electric Vehicle Alliance, bringing together and supporting companies in making and achieving bold commitments to fleet electrification.



Amazon customers can expect to see the delivery vehicles hitting the road in Baltimore, Chicago, Dallas, Kansas City, Nashville, Phoenix, San Diego, Seattle, and St. Louis, among other cities. This will be expanded to 100 cities by the end of the year. There are currently no details for when those outside the U.S. will see similar vehicles, however, earlier this year Amazon launched five electric Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) as part of its UK fleet.",sustainability_news,2022-07-28 09:12:00+00:00,2025-04-01 14:58:42.281230,"['Amazon', 'R', '##ivian', 'Amazon', 'R', '##ivian', 'Amazon', 'Global Optimism', 'The', 'Climate Pledge', 'Microsoft', 'Unilever', 'V', '##erizon', 'Mercedes - Benz', 'Amazon', 'R', '##ivian', 'Amazon', 'Climate Pledge Fund', 'R', '##ivian', 'Amazon', 'R', '##ivian']",Amazon,2022.0,amazon,1.0000001192092896
