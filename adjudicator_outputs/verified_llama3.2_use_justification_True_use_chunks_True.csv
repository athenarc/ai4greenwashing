2,Reducing emissions by over 45% since 2015,"Based on the provided text and relevant context from other pages in the document, I would conclude that the claim of reducing emissions by over 45% since 2015 is substantiated.

The report provides several indicators to support this claim:

1. The statement ""Thanks to this work, we're decoupling business growth from emissions: While our revenue has grown by over 68 percent since 2015, our gross emissions have decreased by over 45 percent."" This suggests that Apple's growth in revenue has not led to an increase in emissions, which could be seen as a sign of successful green initiatives.
2. The section on ""Avoided Emissions"" provides data on the amount of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions avoided since 2015, with numbers ranging from 7.8 million metric tons to 17.4 million metric tons across different categories. This suggests that Apple has made significant progress in reducing its emissions.
3. The report highlights various initiatives taken by Apple to reduce its environmental impact, such as sourcing 100% renewable electricity for facilities, transitioning suppliers to renewable energy, and using low-carbon materials in products. These efforts likely contributed to the reduction in emissions.

While it is possible that some of the data may be based on estimates or assumptions, the report provides sufficient evidence to support the claim of reducing emissions by over 45% since 2015. The company's commitment to transparency and accountability, as stated by Lisa Jackson, also suggests a genuine effort to measure and report its environmental progress.

Therefore, I do not consider this claim to be an example of greenwashing. Greenwashing typically involves making exaggerated or misleading claims about a company's environmental performance to enhance its reputation. In this case, Apple's reporting provides specific data and metrics that support the claim, which suggests a genuine effort to reduce its emissions."
