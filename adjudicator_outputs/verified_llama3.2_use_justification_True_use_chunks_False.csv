2,Reducing emissions by over 45% since 2015,"Based on the provided text and relevant context from other pages in the document, I would conclude that the claim of reducing emissions by over 45% since 2015 is substantiated.

The report provides several indicators to support this claim:

1. The statement ""Thanks to this work, we're decoupling business growth from emissions: While our revenue has grown by over 68 percent since 2015, our gross emissions have decreased by over 45 percent."" This suggests that Apple's growth in revenue has not led to an increase in emissions, which could be seen as a sign of successful green initiatives.
2. The section on ""Avoided Emissions"" provides data on the amount of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions avoided since 2015, with numbers ranging from 7.8 million metric tons to 17.4 million metric tons across different categories. This suggests that Apple has made significant progress in reducing its emissions.
3. The report highlights various initiatives taken by Apple to reduce its environmental impact, such as sourcing 100% renewable electricity for facilities, transitioning suppliers to renewable energy, and using low-carbon materials in products. These efforts likely contributed to the reduction in emissions.

While it is possible that some of the data may be based on estimates or assumptions, the report provides sufficient evidence to support the claim of reducing emissions by over 45% since 2015. The company's commitment to transparency and accountability, as stated by Lisa Jackson, also suggests a genuine effort to measure and report its environmental progress.

Therefore, I do not consider this claim to be an example of greenwashing. Greenwashing typically involves making exaggerated or misleading claims about a company's environmental performance to enhance its reputation. In this case, Apple's reporting provides specific data and metrics that support the claim, which suggests a genuine effort to reduce its emissions."

16,Our Reno data center takes advantage of the mild climate by cooling its servers with outside air whenever possible.,"After reviewing the provided text, I conclude that the claim made by Apple regarding its Reno data center taking advantage of the mild climate by cooling its servers with outside air whenever possible appears to be unsubstantiated and potentially misleading.

While the document does provide some information about energy efficiency efforts in various Apple facilities, including the Reno data center, it lacks concrete evidence to support the specific claim. The text primarily describes general sustainability initiatives, such as using 100% renewable electricity across operations and supply chain, reducing natural gas usage, and implementing water conservation measures.

However, upon closer examination of the document's context, some statements suggest that Apple may not always be able to take advantage of mild climates for cooling servers with outside air. For instance:

1. The Reno data center was opened in 2012, more than a decade ago, which might indicate that the facility has become less efficient over time due to various environmental factors.
2. The text does mention that Apple is ""continuously monitoring and improving"" its cooling systems at data centers, but it also states that these improvements often enable the facility to increase cooling capacity, thereby maximizing server density within the footprint.
3. The document highlights efforts to reduce energy consumption, such as using condensate recovery systems and water treatment technologies, which might imply a greater reliance on mechanical systems for cooling.

Given this context, it is possible that Apple's Reno data center may not always rely on outside air for cooling due to various environmental factors, such as temperature fluctuations or other operational constraints. Without explicit evidence supporting the claim, I consider this statement potentially misleading and, therefore, likely greenwashing.

In order to substantiate the claim, Apple should provide more detailed information about its current cooling practices at the Reno data center, including specific metrics or statistics demonstrating that it consistently uses outside air for cooling in mild climates."
18,Measuring and understanding the carbon footprint of a business is sufficient to reduce energy use.,"Based on the provided text, I would argue that the claim ""Measuring and understanding the carbon footprint of a business is sufficient to reduce energy use"" is largely substantiated by the report. Here's why:

1. Apple provides concrete examples of how they measure and understand their own carbon footprint, including the use of internationally recognized standards like the World Resources Institute (WRI) Greenhouse Gas Protocol and ISO 14040/14044.
2. They share specific metrics on their progress in reducing emissions, such as a 67% reduction since 2011, and highlight efforts to transition facilities to 100% renewable electricity.
3. The report mentions the ""Clean Energy Program,"" which has over 250 suppliers committed to 100% renewable electricity for Apple production, demonstrating a tangible effort to reduce energy use.
4. Additionally, they provide context on their own carbon neutrality goals and progress, including reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 67% since 2011.

While the report does not explicitly state that measuring and understanding the carbon footprint of a business is sufficient to reduce energy use, it provides concrete examples of how Apple has implemented measures to achieve this goal. The claim may be slightly overstated, but it appears to be based on actual efforts and progress made by Apple.

That being said, there are some potential issues with the claim:

1. While measuring and understanding carbon footprints can help identify areas for reduction, it is not a guarantee that energy use will decrease.
2. The report does not provide information on whether other businesses or organizations have attempted to implement similar measures and achieved comparable results.

Overall, while the claim may be slightly overstated, the report substantiates that measuring and understanding carbon footprints can be an important step in reducing energy use, as Apple has demonstrated through their efforts."
